It's my dotfiles! This is me.

These dotfiles are managed using [yadm](https://yadm.io) and are primarily intended
for Fedora. To install, simply clone the repo into `$HOME` and run the bootstrap
scripts in `Executables/shell-scripts/bootstrap`. The scripts for building packages
might max out your CPU all night, so be prepared.

This has been evolving since I was 14, yet nothing here lives that long before being
rewritten.

My scripts generally have the `#!/usr/bin/env dash` shebang, but the syntax is all
POSIX sh compatible.

Bleeding edge
-------------

I like to be on the bleeding edge of programs I use often, but with a stable OS
running underneath them. I worked out the following solution:

If I use a program that runs in the terminal very often, I'll likely build it from
source and update to the latest git commit. Git repositories get cloned using
[ghq](https://github.com/motemen/ghq). This way, if a program has a bug or is missing
a feature I want, I already have the latest snapshot of the repository cloned locally
on my machine so I can better understand the issue, report the bug, and/or push a
patch upstream. My
[`update-all`](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin/update-all)
script runs [these
updates](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/master/Executables/shell-scripts/updates).

C/C++ programs get compiled with the `-march=native` flags, among others. Most
packages are also compiled using link-time optimization. Rust packages containing
C/C++ code use Clang instead of GCC.

I generally compile programs on my desktop and `rsync` them to my laptop.

Mah stuff
---------

Pretty much all my programs run in the terminal. Exceptions include my web browser
(if I [can't avoid it](https://bombadillo.colorfield.space/)), image viewer (imv),
and media player (mpv)). If I'm not browsing heavy websites or playing high-res
video, this setup is lightweight enough to use comfortably on a cheap single-board
computer like the Raspberry Pi.

Stuff labeled with `*` is built from source from the latest git commit.

### General

- WM: [Sway\*](https://swaywm.org/). Associated utilities are also built from source
  (e.g.Â swaybg\*, swayidle\*, grim\*, and slurp\*)
- Terminal emulator: [Foot\*](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot) (Wayland) or
  [st\*](https://st.suckless.org/) (X11)
- Terminal session manager: [tmux\*](https://tmux.github.io/)
- News reader: [Newsboat\*](https://newsboat.org/)
- Mail client: [aerc\*](https://aerc-mail.org/),
  [mbsync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/), and [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/)
- `$EDITOR`: Neovim\*
- Launcher: [custom](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/term-dmenu) (runs in a floating
  terminal window)
- File manager: [nnn\*](https://github.com/jarun/nnn)
- Image viewer: [imv\*](https://github.com/eXeC64/imv)
- IRC and Matrix: WeeChat\* and
  [weechat-matrix\*](https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix), respectively. I
  prefer IRC.
- Web browser: Firefox Nightly with
  [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl),
  [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix), uBlock Origin, and others to make
  browsing slightly more tolerable.
- Gopher/Gemini browser: [bombadillo\*](https://tildegit.org/sloum/bombadillo.git)

### Neovim

I use Neovim's built-in Tree-sitter implementation and Language Server Protocol (LSP)
client along with the official [nvim-lsp](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lsp) plugin
containing pre-made configs for popular language servers. Settings are split between
an `init.vim` and Lua files. Over time, I'll migrate more configs from Vim script to
Lua.

### Shell

- shell (non-interactive): `dash*` for its ridiculously fast startup speed and
  minimal extensions over the POSIX spec. Statically-linked.
- shell (interactive): [custom static build](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/zsh-bin) of
  `zsh*` inside `tmux*`. By using a static binary with full link-time optimization
  that only sources user config files, my shell initialization time for the
  interactive prompt was cut in half.
- plugin manager: [zinit\*](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) loads plugins
  conditionally and asynchronously in the background to avoid slowing down startup
  time.
- prompt: [powerlevel10k\*](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) with
  instant-prompt mode displays a cached prompt while the git status/return status are
  still loading.

### Music

I have an MPD-based music setup; this README includes a screenshot of it near the
top.

I've written several [scripts](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/mpd-scripts) to control MPD
and build playlists. My setup depends heavily upon rating tracks on a scale of 1-10
in the MPD sticker database.

- Backend: MPD
- Frontend: [clerk\*](https://github.com/carnager/clerk) +
  [ncmpcpp\*](https://github.com/arybczak/ncmpcpp). I've been contemplating switching
  to ncmpc since I don't really use any of ncmpcpp's special features.
- CLI control: [mpc\*](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpc) +
  [Playerctl\*](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl).
- Visualizer: [cli-visualizer\*](https://github.com/dpayne/cli-visualizer),
  [cava\*](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) and/or
  [projectM\*](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) depending on my mood.
- Playlist dynamizer:
  [cantata-dynamic\*](https://github.com/CDrummond/cantata/blob/master/playlists/cantata-dynamic)
  builds playlists up to a defined size according to rules. It automatically removes
  and adds tracks after they are played. I don't use cantata; I just use that Perl
  script.
- MPRIS 2 gateway: [mpd-mpris](https://github.com/natsukagami/mpd-mpris). Allows
  media keys to control mpd via Playerctl, and integrates with other MPRIS-aware
  software.
- Album art viewer + notifier: [personal fork](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/kunst) of
  [kunst\*](https://github.com/sdushantha/kunst). My fork works with `imv` and
  displays notifications; I might re-name the project and spin it off into something
  of its own.

### mpv

- Player: [mpv\*](https://mpv.io), built with VapourSynth support using
  [mpv-build](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build). FFmpeg, dav1d, and libass are
  also built from master and statically linked with mpv. libaom, libvpx, libplacebo,
  and some others are built from master and dynamically linked in.
- Upscaling filter: [Anime4k\*](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K) or
  [RAVU](https://github.com/bjin/mpv-prescalers), among
  [others](https://git.sr.ht/~seirdy/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/mpv/mpv.conf)
- MPRIS bridge: [mpv-mpris\*](https://github.com/hoyon/mpv-mpris)
- Other scripts:
  [blur-edges.lua](https://github.com/occivink/mpv-scripts/blob/master/scripts/blur-edges.lua),
  [autocrop.lua](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/TOOLS/lua/autocrop.lua)
