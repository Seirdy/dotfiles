## *** DEFAULT SETTINGS FOR THE ATTACHMENTS PATCH ***
##

##
## Please see the manual (section "attachments")  for detailed
## documentation of the "attachments" command.
##
## Removing a pattern from a list removes that pattern literally. It
## does not remove any type matching the pattern.
##
##  attachments   +A */.*
##  attachments   +A image/jpeg
##  unattachments +A */.*
##
## This leaves "attached" image/jpeg files on the allowed attachments
## list. It does not remove all items, as you might expect, because the
## second */.* is not a matching expression at this time.
##
## Remember: "unattachments" only undoes what "attachments" has done!
## It does not trigger any matching on actual messages.

## Qualify any MIME part with an "attachment" disposition, EXCEPT for
## text/x-vcard and application/pgp parts. (PGP parts are already known
## to neomutt, and can be searched for with ~g, ~G, and ~k.)
##
## I've added x-pkcs7 to this, since it functions (for S/MIME)
## analogously to PGP signature attachments. S/MIME isn't supported
## in a stock neomutt build, but we can still treat it specially here.
##
attachments   +A */.*
attachments   -A text/x-vcard application/pgp.*
attachments   -A application/x-pkcs7-.*

## Discount all MIME parts with an "inline" disposition, unless they're
## text/plain. (Why inline a text/plain part unless it's external to the
## message flow?)
##
attachments   +I text/plain

## These two lines make NeoMutt qualify MIME containers.  (So, for example,
## a message/rfc822 forward will count as an attachment.)  The first
## line is unnecessary if you already have "attach-allow */.*", of
## course.  These are off by default!  The MIME elements contained
## within a message/* or multipart/* are still examined, even if the
## containers themselves don't qualify.
##
#attachments  +A message/.* multipart/.*
#attachments  +I message/.* multipart/.*

## You probably don't really care to know about deleted attachments.
attachments   -A message/external-body
attachments   -I message/external-body

# set abort_backspace=yes
#
# Name: abort_backspace
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, hitting backspace against an empty prompt aborts the
# prompt.
#
#
# set abort_key="007"
#
# Name: abort_key
# Type: string
# Default: "007"
#
#
# Specifies the key that can be used to abort prompts.  The format is the
# same as used in "bind" commands.  The default is equivalent to "\G".
# Note that the specified key should not be used in other bindings, as the
# abort operation has higher precedence and the binding will not have the
# desired effect.
#
# Example:
# set abort_key = "<Esc>"
#
# Please note that when using <Esc> as the abort key, you may also want to
# set the environment variable ESCDELAY to a low value or even 0 which will
# reduce the time that ncurses waits to distinguish singular <Esc> key
# presses from the start of a terminal escape sequence. The default time is
# 1000 milliseconds and thus quite noticeable.
#
#
# set abort_noattach=no
#
# Name: abort_noattach
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
#
#
# If set to yes, when composing messages containing the regular
# expression specified by $abort_noattach_regex and no attachments are
# given, composition will be aborted. If set to no, composing messages
# as such will never be aborted.
#
# Example:
# set abort_noattach_regex = "\\<attach(|ed|ments?)\\>"
#
#
# set abort_noattach_regex="\\<(attach|attached|attachments?)\\>"
#
# Name: abort_noattach_regex
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "\\<(attach|attached|attachments?)\\>"
#
#
# Specifies a regular expression to match against the body of the message, to
# determine if an attachment was mentioned but mistakenly forgotten.  If it
# matches, $abort_noattach will be consulted to determine if message sending
# will be aborted.
#
# Like other regular expressions in NeoMutt, the search is case sensitive
# if the pattern contains at least one upper case letter, and case
# insensitive otherwise.
#
#
# set abort_nosubject=ask-yes
#
# Name: abort_nosubject
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# If set to yes, when composing messages and no subject is given
# at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
# no, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
# prompt will never be aborted.
#
#
# set abort_unmodified=yes
#
# Name: abort_unmodified
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set to yes, composition will automatically abort after
# editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
# check only happens after the first edit of the file).  When set
# to no, composition will never be aborted.
#
#
# set alias_file="~/.neomuttrc"
#
# Name: alias_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.neomuttrc"
#
#
# The default file in which to save aliases created by the
# <create-alias> function. Entries added to this file are
# encoded in the character set specified by $config_charset if it
# is set or the current character set otherwise.
#
# Note: NeoMutt will not automatically source this file; you must
# explicitly use the "source" command for it to be executed in case
# this option points to a dedicated alias file.
#
# The default for this option is the currently used neomuttrc file, or
# "~/.neomuttrc" if no user neomuttrc was found.
#
#
# set alias_format="%3n %f%t %-15a %-56r | %c"
#
# Name: alias_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%3n %f%t %-15a %-56r | %c"
#
#
# Specifies the format of the data displayed for the "alias" menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
# %a      Alias name
# %c      Comment
# %f      Flags - currently, a "d" for an alias marked for deletion
# %n      Index number
# %r      Address which alias expands to
# %t      Character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# %*X     soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# set allow_8bit=yes
#
# Name: allow_8bit
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
# Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.
#
#
# set allow_ansi=no
#
# Name: allow_ansi
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in
# rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
# Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
# their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
# your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
# message could include a line like
# [-- PGP output follows ...
#
# and give it the same color as your attachment color (see also
# $crypt_timestamp).
#
#
# set arrow_cursor=no
#
# Name: arrow_cursor
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, an arrow ("->") will be used to indicate the current entry
# in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
# links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
# be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
# in the menu.
#
#
# set arrow_string="->"
#
# Name: arrow_string
# Type: string
# Default: "->"
#
#
# Specifies the string of arrow_cursor when arrow_cursor enabled.
#
#
# set ascii_chars=no
#
# Name: ascii_chars
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
# and attachment trees, instead of the default ACS characters.
#
#
# set ask_follow_up=no
#
# Name: ask_follow_up
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for follow-up groups before editing
# the body of an outgoing message.
#
#
# set ask_x_comment_to=no
#
# Name: ask_x_comment_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for x-comment-to field before editing
# the body of an outgoing message.
#
#
# set askbcc=no
#
# Name: askbcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
# before editing an outgoing message.
#
#
# set askcc=no
#
# Name: askcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc) recipients before
# editing the body of an outgoing message.
#
#
# set assumed_charset=""
#
# Name: assumed_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
# schemes for messages without character encoding indication.
# Header field values and message body content without character encoding
# indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.
# By default, all the header fields and message body without any charset
# indication are assumed to be in "us-ascii".
#
# For example, Japanese users might prefer this:
# set assumed_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
#
# However, only the first content is valid for the message body.
#
#
# set attach_charset=""
#
# Name: attach_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding
# schemes for text file attachments. NeoMutt uses this setting to guess
# which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them to
# a proper character set given in $send_charset.
#
# If unset, the value of $charset will be used instead.
# For example, the following configuration would work for Japanese
# text handling:
# set attach_charset="iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8"
#
# Note: for Japanese users, "iso-2022-*" must be put at the head
# of the value as shown above if included.
#
#
# set attach_format="%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] "
#
# Name: attach_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] "
#
#
# This variable describes the format of the "attachment" menu.  The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
# %C      Charset
# %c      Requires charset conversion ("n" or "c")
# %D      Deleted flag
# %d      Description (if none, falls back to %F)
# %e      MIME content-transfer-encoding
# %f      Filename
# %F      Filename in content-disposition header (if none, falls back to %f)
# %I      Disposition ("I" for inline, "A" for attachment)
# %m      Major MIME type
# %M      MIME subtype
# %n      Attachment number
# %Q      "Q", if MIME part qualifies for attachment counting
# %s      Size (see formatstrings-size)
# %T      Graphic tree characters
# %t      Tagged flag
# %u      Unlink (=to delete) flag
# %X      Number of qualifying MIME parts in this part and its children
#         (please see the "attachments" section for possible speed effects)
# %>X     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# %*X     Soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.
#
#
# set attach_save_dir="./"
#
# Name: attach_save_dir
# Type: path
# Default: "./"
#
#
# The directory where attachments are saved.
#
#
# set attach_save_without_prompting=no
#
# Name: attach_save_without_prompting
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable, when set to true, will cause attachments to be saved to
# the 'attach_save_dir' location without prompting the user for the filename.
#
#
#
# set attach_sep="\n"
#
# Name: attach_sep
# Type: string
# Default: "\n"
#
#
# The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
# printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.
#
#
# set attach_split=yes
#
# Name: attach_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
# etc) on a list of tagged attachments, NeoMutt will concatenate the
# attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
# $attach_sep separator is added after each attachment. When set,
# NeoMutt will operate on the attachments one by one.
#
#
# set attribution="On %d, %n wrote:"
#
# Name: attribution
# Type: string
# Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"
#
#
# This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
# in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like sequences see
# the section on $index_format.
#
#
# set attribution_locale=""
#
# Name: attribution_locale
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# The locale used by strftime(3) to format dates in the
# attribution string.  Legal values are the strings your system
# accepts for the locale environment variable $LC_TIME.
#
# This variable is to allow the attribution date format to be
# customized by recipient or folder using hooks.  By default, NeoMutt
# will use your locale environment, so there is no need to set
# this except to override that default.
#
#
# set auto_subscribe=no
#
# Name: auto_subscribe
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt assumes the presence of a List-Post header
# means the recipient is subscribed to the list.  Unless the mailing list
# is in the "unsubscribe" or "unlist" lists, it will be added
# to the "subscribe" list.  Parsing and checking these things slows
# header reading down, so this option is disabled by default.
#
#
# set auto_tag=no
#
# Name: auto_tag
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, functions in the index menu which affect a message
# will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
# unset, you must first use the <tag-prefix> function (bound to ";"
# by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.
#
#
# set autocrypt=no
#
# Name: autocrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, enables autocrypt, which provides
# passive encryption protection with keys exchanged via headers.
# See "autocryptdoc" for more details.
# (Autocrypt only)
#
#
# set autocrypt_acct_format="%4n %-30a %20p %10s"
#
# Name: autocrypt_acct_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %-30a %20p %10s"
#
#
# This variable describes the format of the "autocrypt account" menu.
# The following printf(3)-style sequences are understood
# %a      email address
# %k      gpg keyid
# %n      current entry number
# %p      prefer-encrypt flag
# %s      status flag (active/inactive)
#
#
# (Autocrypt only)
#
#
# set autocrypt_dir="~/.mutt/autocrypt"
#
# Name: autocrypt_dir
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.mutt/autocrypt"
#
#
# This variable sets where autocrypt files are stored, including the GPG
# keyring and SQLite database.  See "autocryptdoc" for more details.
# (Autocrypt only)
#
#
# set autocrypt_reply=yes
#
# Name: autocrypt_reply
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, replying to an autocrypt email automatically
# enables autocrypt in the reply.  You may want to unset this if you're using
# the same key for autocrypt as normal web-of-trust, so that autocrypt
# isn't forced on for all encrypted replies.
# (Autocrypt only)
#
#
# set autoedit=no
#
# Name: autoedit
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set along with $edit_headers, NeoMutt will skip the initial
# send-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you to
# immediately begin editing the body of your
# message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
# editing the body of your message.
#
# Note: when this option is set, you can't use send-hooks that depend
# on the recipients when composing a new (non-reply) message, as the initial
# list of recipients is empty.
#
# Also see $fast_reply.
#
#
# set beep=yes
#
# Name: beep
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will beep when an error occurs.
#
#
# set beep_new=no
#
# Name: beep_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will beep whenever it prints a message
# notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
# $beep variable.
#
#
# set bounce=ask-yes
#
# Name: bounce
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
# If set to yes you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
# message. Setting this variable to no is not generally useful,
# and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.
#
#
# set bounce_delivered=yes
#
# Name: bounce_delivered
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will include Delivered-To headers when
# bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to unset this variable.
#
#
# set braille_friendly=no
#
# Name: braille_friendly
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will place the cursor at the beginning
# of the current line in menus, even when the $arrow_cursor variable
# is unset, making it easier for blind persons using Braille displays to
# follow these menus.  The option is unset by default because many
# visual terminals don't permit making the cursor invisible.
#
#
# set browser_abbreviate_mailboxes=yes
#
# Name: browser_abbreviate_mailboxes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will abbreviate mailbox
# names in the browser mailbox list, using '~' and '='
# shortcuts.
#
# The default "alpha" setting of $sort_browser uses
# locale-based sorting (using strcoll(3)), which ignores some
# punctuation.  This can lead to some situations where the order
# doesn't make intuitive sense.  In those cases, it may be
# desirable to unset this variable.
#
#
# set catchup_newsgroup=ask-yes
#
# Name: catchup_newsgroup
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# If this variable is set, NeoMutt will mark all articles in newsgroup
# as read when you quit the newsgroup (catchup newsgroup).
#
#
# set certificate_file="~/.mutt_certificates"
#
# Name: certificate_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.mutt_certificates"
#
#
# This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
# are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
# if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also
# be saved in this file and further connections are automatically
# accepted.
#
# You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
# certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates is
# also automatically accepted.
#
# Example:
# set certificate_file=~/.neomutt/certificates
#
#
# set change_folder_next=no
#
# Name: change_folder_next
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, the <change-folder> function
# mailbox suggestion will start at the next folder in your "mailboxes"
# list, instead of starting at the first folder in the list.
#
#
# set charset=""
#
# Name: charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.
# It is also the fallback for $send_charset.
#
# Upon startup NeoMutt tries to derive this value from environment variables
# such as $LC_CTYPE or $LANG.
#
# Note: It should only be set in case NeoMutt isn't able to determine the
# character set used correctly.
#
#
# set check_mbox_size=no
#
# Name: check_mbox_size
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will use file size attribute instead of
# access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.
#
# This variable is unset by default and should only be enabled when
# new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.
#
# Note that enabling this variable should happen before any "mailboxes"
# directives occur in configuration files regarding mbox or mmdf folders
# because NeoMutt needs to determine the initial new mail status of such a
# mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
# Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.
#
#
# set check_new=yes
#
# Name: check_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Note: this option only affects maildir and MH style
# mailboxes.
#
# When set, NeoMutt will check for new mail delivered while the
# mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
# take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
# checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
# this variable is unset, no check for new mail is performed
# while the mailbox is open.
#
#
# set collapse_all=no
#
# Name: collapse_all
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will collapse all threads when entering a folder.
#
#
# set collapse_flagged=yes
#
# Name: collapse_flagged
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
# flagged messages.
#
#
# set collapse_unread=yes
#
# Name: collapse_unread
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
# unread messages.
#
#
# set compose_format="-- NeoMutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
#
# Name: compose_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-- NeoMutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>-"
#
#
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the "compose"
# menu.  This string is similar to $status_format, but has its own
# set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %a      Total number of attachments
# %h      Local hostname
# %l      Approximate size (in bytes) of the current message (see formatstrings-size)
# %v      NeoMutt version string
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# %*X     soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# See the text describing the $status_format option for more
# information on how to set $compose_format.
#
#
# set compose_show_user_headers=yes
#
# Name: compose_show_user_headers
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, Neomutt will display user-defined headers (set via my_hdr
# or from editing with edit-headers).
#
#
# set config_charset=""
#
# Name: config_charset
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# When defined, NeoMutt will recode commands in rc files from this
# encoding to the current character set as specified by $charset
# and aliases written to $alias_file from the current character set.
#
# Please note that if setting $charset it must be done before
# setting $config_charset.
#
# Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertable
# characters as question marks which can lead to undesired
# side effects (for example in regular expressions).
#
#
# set confirmappend=yes
#
# Name: confirmappend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
# an existing mailbox.

#
# set connect_timeout=30
#
# Name: connect_timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 30
#
#
# Causes NeoMutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP, POP or SMTP) after this
# many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
# value causes NeoMutt to wait indefinitely for the connection attempt to succeed.
#
#
# set content_type="text/plain"
#
# Name: content_type
# Type: string
# Default: "text/plain"
#
#
# Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed messages.
#
#
# set copy=yes
#
# Name: copy
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes

#
set crypt_autoencrypt=no
#
# Name: crypt_autoencrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always attempt to PGP
# encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in
# connection to the "send-hook" command.  It can be overridden
# by use of the pgp menu, when encryption is not required or

#
# set crypt_chars="SPsK "
#
# Name: crypt_chars
# Type: character string
# Default: "SPsK "
#
#
# Controls the characters used in cryptography flags.
# Character Default Description
# 1       S The mail is signed, and the signature is successfully verified.
# 2       P The mail is PGP encrypted.
# 3       s The mail is signed.

#
# set crypt_confirmhook=yes
#
# Name: crypt_confirmhook
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, then you will be prompted for confirmation of keys when using
# the crypt-hook command.  If unset, no such confirmation prompt will
# be presented.  This is generally considered unsafe, especially where
# typos are concerned.
#
#
set crypt_opportunistic_encrypt=no
#
# Name: crypt_opportunistic_encrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to automatically enable and
# disable encryption, based on whether all message recipient keys
# can be located by NeoMutt.
#
# When this option is enabled, NeoMutt will enable/disable encryption
# each time the TO, CC, and BCC lists are edited.  If
# $edit_headers is set, NeoMutt will also do so each time the message
# is edited.
#
# While this is set, encryption can't be manually enabled/disabled.
# The pgp or smime menus provide a selection to temporarily disable
# this option for the current message.
#
# If $crypt_autoencrypt or $crypt_replyencrypt enable encryption for
# a message, this option will be disabled for that message.  It can
# be manually re-enabled in the pgp or smime menus.
# (Crypto only)
#
#
# set crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys=no
#
# Name: crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, this modifies the behavior of $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt
# to only search for "strong keys", that is, keys with full validity
# according to the web-of-trust algorithm.  A key with marginal or no
# validity will not enable opportunistic encryption.
#
# For S/MIME, the behavior depends on the backend.  Classic S/MIME will
# filter for certificates with the 't'(trusted) flag in the .index file.
# The GPGME backend will use the same filters as with OpenPGP, and depends
# on GPGME's logic for assigning the GPGME_VALIDITY_FULL and
# GPGME_VALIDITY_ULTIMATE validity flag.
#
#
# set crypt_protected_headers_read=yes
#
# Name: crypt_protected_headers_read
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will display protected headers ("Memory Hole") in the pager,
# When set, NeoMutt will display protected headers in the pager,
# and will update the index and header cache with revised headers.
#
# Protected headers are stored inside the encrypted or signed part of an
# an email, to prevent disclosure or tampering.
# For more information see https://github.com/autocrypt/protected-headers
# Currently NeoMutt only supports the Subject header.
#
# Encrypted messages using protected headers often substitute the exposed
# Subject header with a dummy value (see $crypt_protected_headers_subject).
# NeoMutt will update its concept of the correct subject after the
# message is opened, i.e. via the <display-message> function.
# If you reply to a message before opening it, NeoMutt will end up using
# the dummy Subject header, so be sure to open such a message first.
# (Crypto only)
#
#
# set crypt_protected_headers_save=no
#
# Name: crypt_protected_headers_save
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When $crypt_protected_headers_read is set, and a message with a
# protected Subject is opened, NeoMutt will save the updated Subject
# into the header cache by default.  This allows searching/limiting
# based on the protected Subject header if the mailbox is
# re-opened, without having to re-open the message each time.
# However, for mbox/mh mailbox types, or if header caching is not
# set up, you would need to re-open the message each time the
# mailbox was reopened before you could see or search/limit on the
# protected subject again.
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt additionally saves the protected
# Subject back in the clear-text message headers.  This
# provides better usability, but with the tradeoff of reduced
# security.  The protected Subject header, which may have
# previously been encrypted, is now stored in clear-text in the
# message headers.  Copying the message elsewhere, via NeoMutt or
# external tools, could expose this previously encrypted data.
# Please make sure you understand the consequences of this before
# you enable this variable.

set crypt_replysignencrypted=yes
#
# Name: crypt_replysignencrypted
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages
# which are encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
# $crypt_replyencrypt, because it allows you to sign all
# messages which are automatically encrypted.  This works around
# the problem noted in $crypt_replysign, that NeoMutt is not able
# to find out whether an encrypted message is also signed.
# (Crypto only)
#
#
# set crypt_timestamp=yes
#
# Name: crypt_timestamp
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will include a time stamp in the lines surrounding
# PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
# If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on these,
# you may unset this setting.
# (Crypto only)
#
#
set crypt_use_gpgme=yes
#
# Name: crypt_use_gpgme
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable controls the use of the GPGME-enabled crypto backends.
# If it is set and NeoMutt was built with GPGME support, the gpgme code for
# S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic code.  Note that
# you need to set this option in .neomuttrc; it won't have any effect when
# used interactively.
#
# Note that the GPGME backend does not support creating old-style inline
# (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages (see $pgp_autoinline).
#
#
set crypt_use_pka=yes
#
# Name: crypt_use_pka
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether NeoMutt uses PKA
# (see http://www.g10code.de/docs/pka-intro.de.pdf) during signature
# verification (only supported by the GPGME backend).
#
#
set crypt_verify_sig=yes
#
# Name: crypt_verify_sig
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# If "yes", always attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME signatures.
# If "ask-*", ask whether or not to verify the signature.

# set date_format="!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
#
# Name: date_format
# Type: string
# Default: "!%a, %b %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S%p %Z"
#
#
# This variable controls the format of the date printed by the "%d"
# sequence in $index_format.  This is passed to the strftime(3)
# function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syntax.
#
# Unless the first character in the string is a bang ("!"), the month
# and week day names are expanded according to the locale.
# If the first character in the string is a
# bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
# rest of the string are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
# English).
#
#
# set debug_file="~/.neomuttdebug"
#
# Name: debug_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.neomuttdebug"
#
#
# Debug logging is controlled by the variables $debug_file and $debug_level.
# $debug_file specifies the root of the filename.  NeoMutt will add "0" to the end.
# Each time NeoMutt is run with logging enabled, the log files are rotated.
# A maximum of five log files are kept, numbered 0 (most recent) to 4 (oldest).
#
# This option can be enabled on the command line, "neomutt -l mylog"
#
# See also: $debug_level
#
#
# set debug_level=0
#
# Name: debug_level
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# Debug logging is controlled by the variables $debug_file and $debug_level.
#
# The debug level controls how much information is saved to the log file.
# If you have a problem with NeoMutt, then enabling logging may help find the cause.
# Levels 1-3 will usually provide enough information for writing a bug report.
# Levels 4,5 will be extremely verbose.
#
# Warning: Logging at high levels may save private information to the file.
#
# This option can be enabled on the command line, "neomutt -d 2"
#
# See also: $debug_file
#
#
# set default_hook="~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
#
# Name: default_hook
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"
#
#
# This variable controls how "message-hook", "reply-hook", "send-hook",
# "send2-hook", "save-hook", and "fcc-hook" will
# be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regex,
# instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
# declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
# variable at the time the hook is declared.
#
# The default value matches
# if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
# given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
# "alternates") and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
# regular expression.
#
#
# set delete=ask-yes
#
# Name: delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when closing or
# synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to yes, messages marked for
# deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
# no, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.
#
#
# set delete_untag=yes
#
# Name: delete_untag
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If this option is set, NeoMutt will untag messages when marking them
# for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
# or when you save it to another folder.
#
#
# set digest_collapse=yes
#
# Name: digest_collapse
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If this option is set, NeoMutt's received-attachments menu will not show the subparts of
# individual messages in a multipart/digest.  To see these subparts, press "v" on that menu.
#
#
# set display_filter=""
#
# Name: display_filter
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
# is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_filter, and the
# filtered message is read from the standard output.
#
# When preparing the message, NeoMutt inserts some escape sequences into the
# text.  They are of the form: <esc>]9;XXX<bel> where "XXX" is a random
# 64-bit number.
#
# If these escape sequences interfere with your filter, they can be removed
# using a tool like ansifilter or sed 's/^\x1b]9;[0-9]\+\x7//'
#
# If they are removed, then PGP and MIME headers will no longer be coloured.
# This can be fixed by adding this to your config:
# color body magenta default '^\[-- .* --\]$'.
#
#
# set dsn_notify=""
#
# Name: dsn_notify
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
# string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
# of the following: never, to never request notification,
# failure, to request notification on transmission failure,
# delay, to be notified of message delays, success, to be
# notified of successful transmission.
#
# Example:
# set dsn_notify="failure,delay"
#
# Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable
# this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA
# providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -N option
# for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it
# depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.
#
#
# set dsn_return=""
#
# Name: dsn_return
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
# messages.  It may be set to either hdrs to return just the
# message header, or full to return the full message.
#
# Example:
# set dsn_return=hdrs
#
# Note: when using $sendmail for delivery, you should not enable
# this unless you are either using Sendmail 8.8.x or greater or a MTA
# providing a sendmail(1)-compatible interface supporting the -R option
# for DSN. For SMTP delivery, DSN support is auto-detected so that it
# depends on the server whether DSN will be used or not.
#
#
# set duplicate_threads=yes
#
# Name: duplicate_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable controls whether NeoMutt, when $sort is set to threads, threads
# messages with the same Message-Id together.  If it is set, it will indicate
# that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
# in the thread tree.
#
#
set edit_headers=yes
#
# Name: edit_headers
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
# along with the body of your message.
#
# Although the compose menu may have localized header labels, the
# labels passed to your editor will be standard RFC2822 headers,
# (e.g. To:, Cc:, Subject:).  Headers added in your editor must
# also be RFC2822 headers, or one of the pseudo headers listed in
# "edit-header".  NeoMutt will not understand localized header
# labels, just as it would not when parsing an actual email.
#
# Note that changes made to the References: and Date: headers are
# ignored for interoperability reasons.
#
#
# set editor="vi"
#
# Name: editor
# Type: command
# Default: "vi"
#
#
# This variable specifies which editor is used by NeoMutt.
# It defaults to the value of the $VISUAL, or $EDITOR, environment
# variable, or to the string "vi" if neither of those are set.
#
# The $editor string may contain a %s escape, which will be replaced by the name
# of the file to be edited.  If the %s escape does not appear in $editor, a
# space and the name to be edited are appended.
#
# The resulting string is then executed by running
# sh -c 'string'
#
# where string is the expansion of $editor described above.
#
#
# set empty_subject="Re: your mail"
#
# Name: empty_subject
# Type: string
# Default: "Re: your mail"
#
#
# This variable specifies the subject to be used when replying to an email
# with an empty subject.  It defaults to "Re: your mail".
#
#
# set encode_from=no
#
# Name: encode_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
# they contain the string "From " (note the trailing space) in the beginning of a line.
# This is useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
# agents tend to do with messages (in order to prevent tools from
# misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).
#
#
# set entropy_file=""
#
# Name: entropy_file
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# The file which includes random data that is used to initialize SSL
# library functions.
#
#
# set envelope_from_address=""
#
# Name: envelope_from_address
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
#
#
# Manually sets the envelope sender for outgoing messages.
# This value is ignored if $use_envelope_from is unset.
#
#
# set external_search_command=""
#
# Name: external_search_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# If set, contains the name of the external program used by "~I" patterns.
# This will usually be a wrapper script around mairix, mu, or similar
# indexers other than notmuch (for which there is optional special support).
#
# Here is an example how it works.  Let's assume $external_search_command
# is set to "mairix_filter", and mairix_filter is a script which
# runs the old but well loved mairix indexer with the arguments
# given to mairix_filter, in the "raw" mode of mairix, producing
# on the standard output a list of Message-IDs, one per line.
#
# If possible, it also filters down the results coming from mairix
# such that only messages in the current folder remain.  It can do
# this because it gets a hidden first argument which is the path
# to the folder.
# (This can be the type of clean and simple script called a one-liner.)
#
# Now if NeoMutt gets a limit or tag command followed by the pattern
# "~I '-t s:bleeping='", mairix_filter runs mairix with the
# arguments from inside the quotes (the quotes are needed because
# of the space after "-t"), mairix finds all messages with
# "bleeping" in the Subject plus all messages sharing threads
# with these and outputs their file names, and mairix_filter
# translates the file names into Message-IDs.  Finally, NeoMutt
# reads the Message-IDs and targets the matching messages with the
# command given to it.
#
# You, the user, still have to rewrite the mairix_filter script to
# match the behavior of your indexer, but this should help users
# of indexers other than notmuch to integrate them cleanly with NeoMutt.
#
#
# set fast_reply=no
#
# Name: fast_reply
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped
# when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is

#
# Note: this variable has no effect when the $autoedit
# variable is set.
#
#
# set fcc_attach=yes
#
# Name: fcc_attach
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages
# are saved along with the main body of your message.
#
#
# set fcc_before_send=no
#
# Name: fcc_before_send
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, FCCs will occur before sending
# the message.  Before sending, the message cannot be manipulated,
# so it will be stored the exact same as sent:
# $fcc_attach and $fcc_clear will be ignored (using their default
# values).
#
# When unset, the default, FCCs will occur after sending.
# Variables $fcc_attach and $fcc_clear will be respected, allowing
# it to be stored without attachments or encryption/signing if
# desired.
#
#
# set fcc_clear=no
#
# Name: fcc_clear
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and

set folder="~/mail/seirdy2"
#
# Name: folder
# Type: mailbox
# Default: "~/Mail"
#
#
# Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A "+" or "=" at the
# beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this
# variable.  Note that if you change this variable (from the default)
# value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs before
# you use "+" or "=" for any other variables since expansion takes place

#
#
# set folder_format="%2C %t %N %F %2l %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %i"
#
# Name: folder_format

# %n requires $mail_check_stats to be set (except for IMAP mailboxes).
#
#
# set followup_to=yes
#
# Name: followup_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not the "Mail-Followup-To:" header field is
# generated when sending mail.  When set, NeoMutt will generate this
# field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
# the "subscribe" or "lists" commands.
#
# This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from
# receiving duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send
# to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply
# separately for any messages sent to known lists to which you are
# not subscribed.
#
# The header will contain only the list's address
# for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
# email address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a
# group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will be
# sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two copies
# of the same email for you.
#
#
# set followup_to_poster=ask-yes
#
# Name: followup_to_poster
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# If this variable is set and the keyword "poster" is present in
# Followup-To header, follow-up to newsgroup function is not
# permitted.  The message will be mailed to the submitter of the
# message via mail.
#
#
# set force_name=no
#
# Name: force_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable is similar to $save_name, except that NeoMutt will
# store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
# you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
#
# Also see the $record variable.
#
#
set forward_attachments=ask-yes
#
# Name: forward_attachments
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# When forwarding inline (i.e. $mime_forward unset or
# answered with "no" and $forward_decode set), attachments
# which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will be attached
# to the newly composed message if this quadoption is set or
# answered with "yes".
#
#
# set forward_attribution_intro="----- Forwarded message from %f -----"
#
# Name: forward_attribution_intro
# Type: string
# Default: "----- Forwarded message from %f -----"
#
#
# This is the string that will precede a message which has been forwarded
# in the main body of a message (when $mime_forward is unset).
# For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like sequences see
# the section on $index_format.  See also $attribution_locale.
#
#
# set forward_attribution_trailer="----- End forwarded message -----"
#
# Name: forward_attribution_trailer
# Type: string
# Default: "----- End forwarded message -----"
#
#
# This is the string that will follow a message which has been forwarded
# in the main body of a message (when $mime_forward is unset).
# For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like sequences see
# the section on $index_format.  See also $attribution_locale.
#
#
# set forward_decode=yes
#
# Name: forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
# This variable is only used, if $mime_forward is unset,
# otherwise $mime_forward_decode is used instead.
#
#
# set forward_decrypt=yes
#
# Name: forward_decrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls the handling of encrypted messages when forwarding a message.
# When set, the outer layer of encryption is stripped off.  This
# variable is only used if $mime_forward is set and
# $mime_forward_decode is unset.
# (PGP only)
#
#
# set forward_edit=yes
#
# Name: forward_edit
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# This quadoption controls whether or not the user is automatically
# placed in the editor when forwarding messages.  For those who always want
# to forward with no modification, use a setting of "no".
#
#
# set forward_format="[%a: %s]"
#
# Name: forward_format
# Type: string
# Default: "[%a: %s]"
#
#
# This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
# It uses the same format sequences as the $index_format variable.
#
#
# set forward_quote=no
#
# Name: forward_quote
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, forwarded messages included in the main body of the
# message (when $mime_forward is unset) will be quoted using
# $indent_string.
#
#
# set forward_references=no
#
# Name: forward_references
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, forwarded messages set the "In-Reply-To:" and
# "References:" headers in the same way as normal replies would. Hence the
# forwarded message becomes part of the original thread instead of starting
# a new one.
#
#
set from="seirdy@seirdy.one"
#
# Name: from
# Type: e-mail address
# Default: ""
#
#
# When set, this variable contains a default "from" address.  It
# can be overridden using "my_hdr" (including from a "send-hook") and
# $reverse_name.  This variable is ignored if $use_from is unset.
#
# If not specified, then it may be read from the environment variable $EMAIL.
#
#
# set from_chars=""
#
# Name: from_chars
# Type: character string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Controls the character used to prefix the %F and %L fields in the
# index.
# Character Description
# 1       Mail is written by you and has a To address, or has a known mailing list in the To address.
# 2       Mail is written by you and has a Cc address, or has a known mailing list in the Cc address.
# 3       Mail is written by you and has a Bcc address.
# 4       All remaining cases.
#
#
# If this is empty or unset (default), the traditional long "To ",
# "Cc " and "Bcc " prefixes are used.  If set but too short to
# include a character for a particular case, a single space will be
# prepended to the field.  To prevent any prefix at all from being
# added in a particular case, use the special value CR (aka ^M)
# for the corresponding character.
#
# This slightly odd interface is necessitated by NeoMutt's handling of
# string variables; one can't tell a variable that is unset from one
# that is set to the empty string.
#
#
# set gecos_mask="^[^,]*"
#
# Name: gecos_mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^[^,]*"
#
#
# A regular expression used by NeoMutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
# entry when expanding the alias.  The default value
# will return the string up to the first "," encountered.
# If the GECOS field contains a string like "lastname, firstname" then you
# should set it to ".*".
#
# This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address an e-mail
# to user ID "stevef" whose full name is "Steve Franklin".  If NeoMutt expands
# "stevef" to '"Franklin" stevef@foo.bar' then you should set the $gecos_mask to
# a regular expression that will match the whole name so NeoMutt will expand
# "Franklin" to "Franklin, Steve".
#
#
# set group_index_format="%4C %M%N %5s  %-45.45f %d"
#
# Name: group_index_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4C %M%N %5s  %-45.45f %d"
#
#
# This variable allows you to customize the newsgroup browser display to
# your personal taste.  This string is similar to "index_format", but
# has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
# %C      Current newsgroup number
# %d      Description of newsgroup (becomes from server)
# %f      Newsgroup name
# %M      - if newsgroup not allowed for direct post (moderated for example)
# %N      N if newsgroup is new, u if unsubscribed, blank otherwise
# %n      Number of new articles in newsgroup
# %s      Number of unread articles in newsgroup
# %>X     Right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     Pad to the end of the line with character "X"
#
#
# set hdrs=yes
#
# Name: hdrs
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, the header fields normally added by the "my_hdr"
# command are not created.  This variable must be unset before
# composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If set,
# the user defined header fields are added to every new message.
#
#
# set header=no
#
# Name: header
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, this variable causes NeoMutt to include the header
# of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
# The $weed setting applies.
#
#
# set header_cache=""
#
# Name: header_cache
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable points to the header cache database. If the path points to
# an existing directory, NeoMutt will create a dedicated header cache
# database per folder. Otherwise, the path points to a regular file, which
# will be created as needed and used as a shared global header cache for
# all folders.
# By default it is unset so no header caching will be used.
#
# Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP
# MH or Maildir folders, see "caching" for details.
#
#
# set header_cache_backend=""
#
# Name: header_cache_backend
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable specifies the header cache backend.  By default it is
# unset so no header caching will be used.
#
#
# set header_cache_compress_level=1
#
# Name: header_cache_compress_level
# Type: number
# Default: 1
#
#
# When NeoMutt is compiled with lz4, zstd or zlib, this option can be used
# to setup the compression level.
#
#
# set header_cache_compress_method=""
#
# Name: header_cache_compress_method
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# When NeoMutt is compiled with lz4, zstd or zlib, the header cache backend
# can use these compression methods for compressing the cache files.
# This results in much smaller cache file sizes and may even improve speed.
#
#
# set header_color_partial=no
#
# Name: header_color_partial
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, color header regexes behave like color body regexes:
# color is applied to the exact text matched by the regex.  When
# unset, color is applied to the entire header.
#
# One use of this option might be to apply color to just the header labels.
#
# See "color" for more details.
#
#
# set help=yes
#
# Name: help
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
# provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
#
# Note: The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
# function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
# the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while NeoMutt is
# running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
# of these should present a major problem.
#
#
# set hidden_host=no
#
# Name: hidden_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will skip the host name part of $hostname variable
# when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
# affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the
# cut-off of first-level domains.
#
#
# set hidden_tags="unread,draft,flagged,passed,replied,attachment,signed,encrypted"
#
# Name: hidden_tags
# Type: string list
# Default: "unread,draft,flagged,passed,replied,attachment,signed,encrypted"
#
#
# This variable specifies private notmuch/imap tags which should not be printed
# on screen.
#
#
# set hide_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, in the thread tree.
#
#
# set hide_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
# thread tree.
#
#
# set hide_thread_subject=yes
#
# Name: hide_thread_subject
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread
# tree that have the same subject as their parent or closest previously
# displayed sibling.
#
#
# set hide_top_limited=no
#
# Name: hide_top_limited
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
# by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when
# $hide_limited is set, this option will have no effect.
#
#
# set hide_top_missing=yes
#
# Name: hide_top_missing
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
# top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_missing is
# set, this option will have no effect.
#
#
# set history=10
#
# Name: history
# Type: number
# Default: 10
#
#
# This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
# the string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared each time the
# variable is set.
#
#
# set history_file="~/.mutthistory"
#
# Name: history_file
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.mutthistory"
#
#
# The file in which NeoMutt will save its history.
#
# Also see $save_history.
#
#
# set history_remove_dups=no
#
# Name: history_remove_dups
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, all of the string history will be scanned for duplicates
# when a new entry is added.  Duplicate entries in the $history_file will
# also be removed when it is periodically compacted.
#
#
# set honor_disposition=no
#
# Name: honor_disposition
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not display attachments with a
# disposition of "attachment" inline even if it could
# render the part to plain text. These MIME parts can only
# be viewed from the attachment menu.
#
# If unset, NeoMutt will render all MIME parts it can
# properly transform to plain text.
#
#
# set honor_followup_to=yes
#
# Name: honor_followup_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
# honored when group-replying to a message.
#
#
set hostname="seirdy.one"
#
# Name: hostname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Specifies the fully-qualified hostname of the system NeoMutt is running on
# containing the host's name and the DNS domain it belongs to. It is used
# as the domain part (after "@") for local email addresses as well as
# Message-Id headers.
#
# If not specified in a config file, then NeoMutt will try to determine the hostname itself.
#
# Optionally, NeoMutt can be compiled with a fixed domain name.
#
# Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.
#
#
# set idn_decode=yes
#
# Name: idn_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will show you international domain names decoded.
# Note: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is unset.
# This variable only affects decoding. (IDN only)
#
#
# set idn_encode=yes
#
# Name: idn_encode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will encode international domain names using
# IDN.  Unset this if your SMTP server can handle newer (RFC6531)
# UTF-8 encoded domains. (IDN only)
#
#
# set ignore_list_reply_to=no
#
# Name: ignore_list_reply_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Affects the behavior of the <reply> function when replying to
# messages from mailing lists (as defined by the "subscribe" or
# "lists" commands).  When set, if the "Reply-To:" field is
# set to the same value as the "To:" field, NeoMutt assumes that the
# "Reply-To:" field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
# to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
# mailing list when this option is set, use the <list-reply>
# function; <group-reply> will reply to both the sender and the
# list.
#
#
# set imap_authenticators=""
#
# Name: imap_authenticators
# Type: string list
# Default: ""
#
#
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order NeoMutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either "login" or the right
# side of an IMAP "AUTH=xxx" capability string, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi"
# or "cram-md5". This option is case-insensitive. If it's
# unset (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods,
# in order from most-secure to least-secure.
#
# Example:
# set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram-md5:login"
#
# Note: NeoMutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
# the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
# authentication fails, NeoMutt will not connect to the IMAP server.
#
#
# set imap_check_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_check_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from
# your server whenever a mailbox is selected, and add them to the set
# of mailboxes it polls for new mail just as if you had issued individual
# "mailboxes" commands.
#
#
# set imap_condstore=no
#
# Name: imap_condstore
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will use the CONDSTORE extension (RFC7162)
# if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
# used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.
#
# For some IMAP servers, enabling this will slightly speed up
# downloading initial messages.  Unfortunately, Gmail is not one
# those, and displays worse performance when enabled.  Your
# mileage may vary.
#
#
# set imap_deflate=yes
#
# Name: imap_deflate
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will use the COMPRESS=DEFLATE extension (RFC4978)
# if advertised by the server.
#
# In general a good compression efficiency can be achieved, which
# speeds up reading large mailboxes also on fairly good connections.
#
#
# set imap_delim_chars="/."
#
# Name: imap_delim_chars
# Type: string
# Default: "/."
#
#
# This contains the list of characters that NeoMutt will use as folder
# separators for IMAP paths, when no separator is provided on the IMAP
# connection.
#
#
# set imap_fetch_chunk_size=0
#
# Name: imap_fetch_chunk_size
# Type: number (long)
# Default: 0
#
#
# When set to a value greater than 0, new headers will be
# downloaded in groups of this many headers per request.  If you
# have a very large mailbox, this might prevent a timeout and
# disconnect when opening the mailbox, by sending a FETCH per set
# of this many headers, instead of a single FETCH for all new
# headers.
#
#
# set imap_headers=""
#
# Name: imap_headers
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# NeoMutt requests these header fields in addition to the default headers
# ("Date:", "From:", "Sender:", "Subject:", "To:", "Cc:", "Message-Id:",
# "References:", "Content-Type:", "Content-Description:", "In-Reply-To:",
# "Reply-To:", "Lines:", "List-Post:", "X-Label:") from IMAP
# servers before displaying the index menu. You may want to add more
# headers for spam detection.
#
# Note: This is a space separated list, items should be uppercase
# and not contain the colon, e.g. "X-BOGOSITY X-SPAM-STATUS" for the
# "X-Bogosity:" and "X-Spam-Status:" header fields.
#
#
# set imap_idle=no
#
# Name: imap_idle
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE extension
# to check for new mail in the current mailbox. Some servers
# (dovecot was the inspiration for this option) react badly
# to NeoMutt's implementation. If your connection seems to freeze
# up periodically, try unsetting this.
#
#
# set imap_keepalive=300
#
# Name: imap_keepalive
# Type: number
# Default: 300
#
#
# This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that NeoMutt
# will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
# from closing them before NeoMutt has finished with them. The default is
# well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
# a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
# violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
# getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.
#
#
# set imap_list_subscribed=no
#
# Name: imap_list_subscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
# only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
# IMAP browser with the <toggle-subscribed> function.
#
#
# set imap_login=""
#
# Name: imap_login
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Your login name on the IMAP server.
#
# This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.
#
#
# set imap_oauth_refresh_command=""
#
# Name: imap_oauth_refresh_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for
# authorizing your connection to your IMAP server.  This command will be
# run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER authentication
# mechanism.  See "oauth" for details.
#
#
# set imap_pass=""
#
# Name: imap_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, NeoMutt will
# prompt you for your password when you invoke the <imap-fetch-mail> function
# or try to open an IMAP folder.
#
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc even
# if you are the only one who can read the file.
#
#
# set imap_passive=yes
#
# Name: imap_passive
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
# mail.  NeoMutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
# connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted for
# user/password pairs on NeoMutt invocation, or if opening the connection
# is slow.
#
#
# set imap_peek=yes
#
# Name: imap_peek
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
# you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
# but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
# exists to appease speed freaks.
#
#
# set imap_pipeline_depth=15
#
# Name: imap_pipeline_depth
# Type: number
# Default: 15
#
#
# Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up before they
# are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline reduces the amount of time
# NeoMutt must wait for the server, and can make IMAP servers feel much
# more responsive. But not all servers correctly handle pipelined commands,
# so if you have problems you might want to try setting this variable to 0.
#
# Note: Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.
#
#
# set imap_poll_timeout=15
#
# Name: imap_poll_timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 15
#
#
# This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds
# that NeoMutt will wait for a response when polling IMAP connections
# for new mail, before timing out and closing the connection.  Set
# to 0 to disable timing out.
#
#
# set imap_qresync=no
#
# Name: imap_qresync
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will use the QRESYNC extension (RFC7162)
# if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
# used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.
#
# Note: this feature is currently experimental.  If you experience
# strange behavior, such as duplicate or missing messages please
# file a bug report to let us know.
#
#
# set imap_rfc5161=yes
#
# Name: imap_rfc5161
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will use the IMAP ENABLE extension (RFC5161) to
# select CAPABILITIES. Some servers (notably Coremail System IMap Server) do
# not properly respond to ENABLE commands, which might cause NeoMutt to hang.
# If your connection seems to freeze at login, try unsetting this. See also
# https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1689
#
#
# set imap_servernoise=yes
#
# Name: imap_servernoise
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
# server as error messages. Since these messages are often
# harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
# server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
# them at some point.
#
#
# set imap_user=""
#
# Name: imap_user
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP
# server.
#
# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
#
#
# set implicit_autoview=no
#
# Name: implicit_autoview
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set to "yes", NeoMutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
# "copiousoutput" flag set for every MIME attachment it doesn't have
# an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, NeoMutt will
# use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
# form.
#
#
# set include=ask-yes
#
# Name: include
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
# is included in your reply.
#
#
# set include_encrypted=no
#
# Name: include_encrypted
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes separately encrypted attachment
# contents when replying.
#
# This variable was added to prevent accidental exposure of encrypted
# contents when replying to an attacker.  If a previously encrypted message
# were attached by the attacker, they could trick an unwary recipient into
# decrypting and including the message in their reply.
#
#
# set include_onlyfirst=no
#
# Name: include_onlyfirst
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes only the first attachment
# of the message you are replying.
#
#
# set indent_string="> "
#
# Name: indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: "> "
#
#
# Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
# message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
# change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
#
# The value of this option is ignored if $text_flowed is set, because
# the quoting mechanism is strictly defined for format=flowed.
#
# This option is a format string, please see the description of
# $index_format for supported printf(3)-style sequences.
#
#
# set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
#
# Name: index_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
#
#
# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
# your personal taste.
#
# "Format strings" are similar to the strings used in the C
# function printf(3) to format output (see the man page for more details).
# For an explanation of the %? construct, see the status_format description.
# The following sequences are defined in NeoMutt:
# %a      Address of the author
# %A      Reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
# %b      Filename of the original message folder (think mailbox)
# %B      The list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b).
# %C      Current message number
# %c      Number of characters (bytes) in the body of the message (see formatstrings-size)
# %cr     Number of characters (bytes) in the raw message, including the header (see formatstrings-size)
# %D      Date and time of message using date_format and local timezone
# %d      Date and time of message using date_format and sender's timezone
# %e      Current message number in thread
# %E      Number of messages in current thread
# %F      Author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
# %Fp     Like %F, but plain. No contextual formatting is applied to recipient name
# %f      Sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
# %g      Newsgroup name (if compiled with NNTP support)
# %g      Message tags (e.g. notmuch tags/imap flags)
# %Gx     Individual message tag (e.g. notmuch tags/imap flags)
# %H      Spam attribute(s) of this message
# %I      Initials of author
# %i      Message-id of the current message
# %J      Message tags (if present, tree unfolded, and != parent's tags)
# %K      The list to which the letter was sent (if any; otherwise: empty)
# %L      If an address in the "To:" or "Cc:" header field matches an address
#         Defined by the user's "subscribe" command, this displays
#         "To <list-name>", otherwise the same as %F
# %l      number of lines in the unprocessed message (may not work with
#         maildir, mh, and IMAP folders)
# %M      Number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed
# %m      Total number of message in the mailbox
# %N      Message score
# %n      Author's real name (or address if missing)
# %O      Original save folder where NeoMutt would formerly have
#         Stashed the message: list name or recipient name
#         If not sent to a list
# %P      Progress indicator for the built-in pager (how much of the file has been displayed)
# %q      Newsgroup name (if compiled with NNTP support)
# %R      Comma separated list of "Cc:" recipients
# %r      Comma separated list of "To:" recipients
# %S      Single character status of the message ("N"/"O"/"D"/"d"/"!"/"r"/"*")
# %s      Subject of the message
# %T      The appropriate character from the $to_chars string
# %t      "To:" field (recipients)
# %u      User (login) name of the author
# %v      First name of the author, or the recipient if the message is from you
# %W      Name of organization of author ("Organization:" field)
# %x      "X-Comment-To:" field (if present and compiled with NNTP support)
# %X      Number of MIME attachments
#         (please see the "attachments" section for possible speed effects)
# %Y      "X-Label:" field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread tree,
#         (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) "X-Label:" is different from
#         Preceding message's "X-Label:"
# %y      "X-Label:" field, if present
# %Z      A three character set of message status flags.
#         The first character is new/read/replied flags ("n"/"o"/"r"/"O"/"N").
#         The second is deleted or encryption flags ("D"/"d"/"S"/"P"/"s"/"K").
#         The third is either tagged/flagged ("*"/"!"), or one of the characters
#         Listed in $to_chars.
# %zc     Message crypto flags
# %zs     Message status flags
# %zt     Message tag flags
# %@name@ insert and evaluate format-string from the matching
#         "index-format-hook" command
# %{fmt}  the date and time of the message is converted to sender's
#         time zone, and "fmt" is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %[fmt]  the date and time of the message is converted to the local
#         time zone, and "fmt" is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %(fmt)  the local date and time when the message was received.
#         "fmt" is expanded by the library function strftime(3);
#         a leading bang disables locales
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# %*X     soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# Date format expressions can be constructed based on relative dates. Using
# the date formatting operators along with nested conditionals, the date
# format can be modified based on how old a message is.  See the section on
# "Conditional Dates" for an explanation and examples
#
# Note that for mbox/mmdf, "%l" applies to the unprocessed message, and
# for maildir/mh, the value comes from the "Lines:" header field when
# present (the meaning is normally the same). Thus the value depends on
# the encodings used in the different parts of the message and has little
# meaning in practice.
#
# "Soft-fill" deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification
# will print everything to the left of the "%>", displaying padding and
# whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
# soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space
# to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
# necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
# rightward text.
#
# Note that these expandos are supported in
# "save-hook", "fcc-hook" and "fcc-save-hook", too.
#
#
# set inews=""
#
# Name: inews
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# If set, specifies the program and arguments used to deliver news posted
# by NeoMutt.  Otherwise, NeoMutt posts article using current connection to
# news server.  The following printf-style sequence is understood:
# %a      account url
# %p      port
# %P      port if specified
# %s      news server name
# %S      url schema
# %u      username

#
#
# How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell-checking software).
#
#
# set keep_flagged=no
#
# Name: keep_flagged
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be moved
# from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of
# a "mbox-hook" command.
#
#
# set mail_check=5
#
# Name: mail_check
# Type: number
# Default: 5
#
#
# This variable configures how often (in seconds) NeoMutt should look for
# new mail. Also see the $timeout variable.
#
#
# set mail_check_recent=yes
#
# Name: mail_check_recent
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will only notify you about new mail that has been received
# since the last time you opened the mailbox.  When unset, NeoMutt will notify you
# if any new mail exists in the mailbox, regardless of whether you have visited it
# recently.
#
# When $mark_old is set, NeoMutt does not consider the mailbox to contain new
# mail if only old messages exist.
#
#
# set mail_check_stats=no
#
# Name: mail_check_stats
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will periodically calculate message
# statistics of a mailbox while polling for new mail.  It will
# check for unread, flagged, and total message counts.  Because
# this operation is more performance intensive, it defaults to
# unset, and has a separate option, $mail_check_stats_interval, to
# control how often to update these counts.
#
# Message statistics can also be explicitly calculated by invoking the
# <check-stats> function.
#
#
# set mail_check_stats_interval=60
#
# Name: mail_check_stats_interval
# Type: number
# Default: 60
#
#
# When $mail_check_stats is set, this variable configures
# how often (in seconds) NeoMutt will update message counts.
#
#
set mailcap_path="~/.config/neomutt/mailcap:~/.mailcap:/usr/share/neomutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"
#
# Name: mailcap_path
# Type: string list
# Default: "~/.mailcap:/usr/share/neomutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"
#
#
# This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting to
# display MIME bodies not directly supported by NeoMutt.  The default value
# is generated during startup: see the "mailcap" section of the manual.
#
# $mailcap_path is overridden by the environment variable $MAILCAPS.
#
# The default search path is from RFC1524.
#
#
# set mailcap_sanitize=yes
#
# Name: mailcap_sanitize
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos
# to a well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
# but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
#
# DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
# DOING!
#
#
# set maildir_check_cur=no
#
# Name: maildir_check_cur
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will poll both the new and cur directories of
# a maildir folder for new messages.  This might be useful if other
# programs interacting with the folder (e.g. dovecot) are moving new
# messages to the cur directory.  Note that setting this option may
# slow down polling for new messages in large folders, since NeoMutt has
# to scan all cur messages.
#
#
# set maildir_header_cache_verify=yes
#
# Name: maildir_header_cache_verify
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Check for Maildir unaware programs other than NeoMutt having modified maildir
# files when the header cache is in use.  This incurs one stat(2) per
# message every time the folder is opened (which can be very slow for NFS
# folders).
#
#
# set maildir_trash=no
#
# Name: maildir_trash
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
# trashed flag instead of unlinked.  Note: this only applies
# to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
# mailbox types.
#
#
# set mark_macro_prefix="'"
#
# Name: mark_macro_prefix
# Type: string
# Default: "'"
#
#
# Prefix for macros created using mark-message.  A new macro
# automatically generated with <mark-message>a will be composed
# from this prefix and the letter a.
#
#
# set mark_old=yes
#
# Name: mark_old
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt marks new unread
# messages as old if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
# With this option set, the next time you start NeoMutt, the messages
# will show up with an "O" next to them in the index menu,
# indicating that they are old.
#
#
# set markers=yes
#
# Name: markers
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a
# "+" marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines.
#
# Also see the $smart_wrap variable.
#
#
set mask="!^\\.[^.]"
#
# Name: mask
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "!^\\.[^.]"
#
#
# A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by
# the not operator "!".  Only files whose names match this mask
# will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.
#
#
set mbox="~/mail/seirdy2"
#
# Name: mbox
# Type: mailbox
# Default: "~/mbox"
#
#
# This specifies the folder into which read mail in your $spoolfile
# folder will be appended.
#
# Also see the $move variable.
#
#
set mbox_type=Maildir
#
# Name: mbox_type
# Type: enumeration
# Default: mbox
#
#
# The default mailbox type used when creating new folders. May be any of
# "mbox", "MMDF", "MH" or "Maildir".
#
# This can also be set using the -m command-line option.
#
#
# set menu_context=0
#
# Name: menu_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
# when scrolling through menus. (Similar to $pager_context.)
#
#
# set menu_move_off=yes
#
# Name: menu_move_off
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, the bottom entry of menus will never scroll up past
# the bottom of the screen, unless there are less entries than lines.
# When set, the bottom entry may move off the bottom.
#
#
# set menu_scroll=no
#
# Name: menu_scroll
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
# attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If unset, the screen
# is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
# (useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).
#
#
# set message_cache_clean=no
#
# Name: message_cache_clean
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will clean out obsolete entries from the message cache when
# the mailbox is synchronized. You probably only want to set it
# every once in a while, since it can be a little slow
# (especially for large folders).
#
#
# set message_cachedir=""
#
# Name: message_cachedir
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# Set this to a directory and NeoMutt will cache copies of messages from
# your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free to remove entries at any
# time.
#
# When setting this variable to a directory, NeoMutt needs to fetch every
# remote message only once and can perform regular expression searches
# as fast as for local folders.
#
# Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.
#
#
# set message_format="%s"
#
# Name: message_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%s"
#
#
# This is the string displayed in the "attachment" menu for
# attachments of type message/rfc822.  For a full listing of defined
# printf(3)-like sequences see the section on $index_format.
#
#
# set meta_key=no
#
# Name: meta_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, forces NeoMutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
# set as if the user had pressed the Esc key and whatever key remains
# after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
# has an ASCII value of 0xf8, then this is treated as if the user had
# pressed Esc then "x".  This is because the result of removing the
# high bit from 0xf8 is 0x78, which is the ASCII character
# "x".
#
#
# set metoo=no
#
# Name: metoo
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If unset, NeoMutt will remove your address (see the "alternates"
# command) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.
#
#
# set mh_purge=no
#
# Name: mh_purge
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When unset, NeoMutt will mimic mh's behavior and rename deleted messages
# to ,<old file name> in mh folders instead of really deleting
# them. This leaves the message on disk but makes programs reading the folder
# ignore it. If the variable is set, the message files will simply be
# deleted.
#
# This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir folders.
#
#
# set mh_seq_flagged="flagged"
#
# Name: mh_seq_flagged
# Type: string
# Default: "flagged"
#
#
# The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.
#
#
# set mh_seq_replied="replied"
#
# Name: mh_seq_replied
# Type: string
# Default: "replied"
#
#
# The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.
#
#
# set mh_seq_unseen="unseen"
#
# Name: mh_seq_unseen
# Type: string
# Default: "unseen"
#
#
# The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.
#
#
# set mime_forward=no
#
# Name: mime_forward
# Type: quadoption
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
# separate message/rfc822 MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
# message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
# can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
# to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
# variable to "ask-no" or "ask-yes".
#
# Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.
#
#
# set mime_forward_decode=no
#
# Name: mime_forward_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
# forwarding a message while $mime_forward is set. Otherwise
# $forward_decode is used instead.
#
#
# set mime_forward_rest=yes
#
# Name: mime_forward_rest
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the attachment
# menu, attachments which can't be decoded in a reasonable manner will
# be attached to the newly composed message if this option is set.
#
#
# set mime_subject=yes
#
# Name: mime_subject
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If unset, 8-bit "subject:" line in article header will not be
# encoded according to RFC2047 to base64.  This is useful when message
# is Usenet article, because MIME for news is nonstandard feature.
#
#
# set mime_type_query_command=""
#
# Name: mime_type_query_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# This specifies a command to run, to determine the mime type of a
# new attachment when composing a message.  Unless
# $mime_type_query_first is set, this will only be run if the
# attachment's extension is not found in the mime.types file.
#
# The string may contain a "%s", which will be substituted with the
# attachment filename.  NeoMutt will add quotes around the string substituted
# for "%s" automatically according to shell quoting rules, so you should
# avoid adding your own.  If no "%s" is found in the string, NeoMutt will
# append the attachment filename to the end of the string.
#
# The command should output a single line containing the
# attachment's mime type.
#
# Suggested values are "xdg-mime query filetype" or
# "file -bi".
#
#
# set mime_type_query_first=no
#
# Name: mime_type_query_first
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, the $mime_type_query_command will be run before the
# mime.types lookup.
#
#
# set mix_entry_format="%4n %c %-16s %a"
#
# Name: mix_entry_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%4n %c %-16s %a"
#
#
# This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the mixmaster
# chain selection screen.  The following printf(3)-like sequences are
# supported:
# %a      The remailer's e-mail address
# %c      Remailer capabilities
# %n      The running number on the menu
# %s      The remailer's short name
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"
# %*X     soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# set mixmaster="mixmaster"
#
# Name: mixmaster
# Type: command
# Default: "mixmaster"
#
#
# This variable contains the path to the Mixmaster binary on your

# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may

#
# set pager="builtin"
#
# Name: pager
# Type: command
# Default: "builtin"
#
#
# This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
# messages. The value "builtin" means to use the built-in pager, otherwise this
# variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
# like to use.
#
# Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional

#
#
# set pager_context=0
#
# Name: pager_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given

# section.
#
#
# set pager_index_lines=0
#
# Name: pager_index_lines
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
# the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
# folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
# giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
# message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
# remain to be read in the current thread.  A value of 0 results in no index
# being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder is less than
# $pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as many lines as it needs.
#
#
# set pager_stop=no

# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP
# messages whenever the user performs an operation which ordinarily would
# result in the contents of the message being operated on.  For example,
# if the user displays a pgp-traditional message which has not been manually

# check the message for traditional pgp.
#
#
# set pgp_autoinline=no
#
# Name: pgp_autoinline
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This option controls whether NeoMutt generates old-style inline
# (traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
# circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu,
# when inline is not required.  The GPGME backend does not support
# this option.
#
# Note that NeoMutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
# which consist of more than a single MIME part.  NeoMutt can be
# configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
# (traditional) would not work.

#
# set pgp_check_gpg_decrypt_status_fd=yes
#
# Name: pgp_check_gpg_decrypt_status_fd
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will check the status file descriptor output
# of $pgp_decrypt_command and $pgp_decode_command for GnuPG status codes
# indicating successful decryption.  This will check for the presence of
# DECRYPTION_OKAY, absence of DECRYPTION_FAILED, and that all
# PLAINTEXT occurs between the BEGIN_DECRYPTION and END_DECRYPTION
# status codes.
#
# If unset, NeoMutt will instead match the status fd output

# Name: pgp_decode_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode

#
# The PGP command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %a      The value of $pgp_sign_as if set, otherwise the value
#         of $pgp_default_key.
# %f      Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
# %p      Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty
#         string otherwise. Note: This may be used with a %? construct.
# %r      One or more key IDs (or fingerprints if available).
# %s      Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
#         of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
#
#
# For examples on how to configure these formats for the various versions

# <tag-prefix>.  If this variable is unset, when piping a list of
# tagged messages NeoMutt will concatenate the messages and will pipe them
# all concatenated.  When set, NeoMutt will pipe the messages one by one.
# In both cases the messages are piped in the current sorted order,
# and the $pipe_sep separator is added after each message.
#
#
# set pop_auth_try_all=yes
#
# Name: pop_auth_try_all
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will try all available authentication methods.
# When unset, NeoMutt will only fall back to other authentication
# methods if the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is
# available but authentication fails, NeoMutt will not connect to the POP server.
#
#
# set pop_authenticators=""
#
# Name: pop_authenticators
# Type: string list
# Default: ""
#
#
# This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
# attempt to use to log in to an POP server, in the order NeoMutt should
# try them.  Authentication methods are either "user", "apop" or any
# SASL mechanism, e.g. "digest-md5", "gssapi" or "cram-md5".
# This option is case-insensitive. If this option is unset
# (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from
# most-secure to least-secure.
#
# Example:
# set pop_authenticators="digest-md5:apop:user"
#
#
# set pop_checkinterval=60
#
# Name: pop_checkinterval
# Type: number
# Default: 60
#
#
# This variable configures how often (in seconds) NeoMutt should look for
# new mail in the currently selected mailbox if it is a POP mailbox.
#
#
# set pop_delete=ask-no
#
# Name: pop_delete
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP
# server when using the <fetch-mail> function.  When unset, NeoMutt will
# download messages but also leave them on the POP server.
#
#
# set pop_host=""
#
# Name: pop_host
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# The name of your POP server for the <fetch-mail> function.  You
# can also specify an alternative port, username and password, i.e.:
# [pop[s]://][username[:password]@]popserver[:port]
#
# where "[...]" denotes an optional part.
#
#
# set pop_last=no
#
# Name: pop_last
# Type: boolean
# Default: no

# the <fetch-mail> function.
#
#
# set pop_oauth_refresh_command=""
#
# Name: pop_oauth_refresh_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for

# run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER authentication
# mechanism.  See "oauth" for details.
#
#
# set pop_pass=""
#
# Name: pop_pass
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, NeoMutt will
# prompt you for your password when you open a POP mailbox.
#
# Warning: you should only use this option when you are on a
# fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc
# even if you are the only one who can read the file.
#
#
# set pop_reconnect=ask-yes
#
# Name: pop_reconnect
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt will try to reconnect to the POP server if

# This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.
#
#
# set post_indent_string=""
#
# Name: post_indent_string
# Type: string
# Default: ""

# Similar to the $attribution variable, NeoMutt will append this
# string after the inclusion of a message which is being replied to.
#
#
# set post_moderated=ask-yes
#
# Name: post_moderated
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# If set to yes, NeoMutt will post article to newsgroup that have

# does not support posting to that newsgroup or totally read-only, that
# posting will not have an effect.
#
#
# set postpone=ask-yes
#
# Name: postpone
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not messages are saved in the $postponed
# mailbox when you elect not to send immediately. If set to

# (postpone) draft message?" when quitting from the "compose"
# screen.
#
# Also see the $recall variable.
#
#
# set postpone_encrypt=yes
#
# Name: postpone_encrypt
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, postponed messages that are marked for encryption will be
# self-encrypted.  NeoMutt will first try to encrypt using the value specified
# in $pgp_default_key or $smime_default_key.  If those are not
# set, it will try the deprecated $postpone_encrypt_as.
# (Crypto only)
#
#
# set postpone_encrypt_as=""
#
# Name: postpone_encrypt_as
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This is a deprecated fall-back variable for $postpone_encrypt.

#
set postponed="+Drafts"
#
# Name: postponed
# Type: mailbox
# Default: "~/postponed"
#
#
# NeoMutt allows you to indefinitely "postpone sending a message" which
# you are editing.  When you choose to postpone a message, NeoMutt saves it
# in the mailbox specified by this variable.
#
# Also see the $postpone variable.
#
#
# set preconnect=""
#
# Name: preconnect
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# If set, a shell command to be executed if NeoMutt fails to establish
# a connection to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
# connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the command returns a  nonzero
# status, NeoMutt gives up opening the server. Example:
# set preconnect="ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net \
# sleep 20 < /dev/null > /dev/null"
#
# Mailbox "foo" on "mailhost.net" can now be reached

# RFC8255 : user preferred languages to be search in parts and display
# Ex. : set preferred_languages="en,fr,de"
#
#
# set print=ask-no
#
# Name: print
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-no
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt really prints messages.
# This is set to "ask-no" by default, because some people
# accidentally hit "p" often.
#
#
# set print_command="lpr"
#
# Name: print_command
# Type: command
# Default: "lpr"
#
#
# This specifies the command pipe that should be used to print messages.
#
#
# set print_decode=yes
#
# Name: print_decode
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Used in connection with the <print-message> function.  If this
# option is set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
# external command specified by $print_command.  If this option
# is unset, no processing will be applied to the message when
# printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
# some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
# e-mail messages for printing.
#
# Also see $print_decode_weed, which controls whether headers will
# be weeded when this is set.
#
#
# set print_decode_weed=yes
#
# Name: print_decode_weed
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# For <print-message>, when $print_decode is set, this
# further controls whether NeoMutt will weed headers.
#
#
# set print_split=no
#
# Name: print_split
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Used in connection with the <print-message> function.  If this option
# is set, the command specified by $print_command is executed once for
# each message which is to be printed.  If this option is unset,
# the command specified by $print_command is executed only once, and
# all the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message
# separator.
#
# Those who use the enscript(1) program's mail-printing mode will
# most likely want to set this option.
#
#
# set prompt_after=yes
#
# Name: prompt_after
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If you use an external $pager, setting this variable will
# cause NeoMutt to prompt you for a command when the pager exits rather
# than returning to the index menu.  If unset, NeoMutt will return to the
# index menu when the external pager exits.
#
#
# set query_command=""
#
# Name: query_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# This specifies the command NeoMutt will use to make external address
# queries.  The string may contain a "%s", which will be substituted
# with the query string the user types.  NeoMutt will add quotes around the
# string substituted for "%s" automatically according to shell quoting
# rules, so you should avoid adding your own.  If no "%s" is found in
# the string, NeoMutt will append the user's query to the end of the string.
# See "query" for more information.
#
#
# set query_format="%3c %t %-25.25n %-25.25a | %e"
#
# Name: query_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%3c %t %-25.25n %-25.25a | %e"
#
#
# This variable describes the format of the "query" menu. The
# following printf(3)-style sequences are understood:
# %a        Destination address
# %c        Current entry number
# %e      * Extra information
# %n        Destination name
# %t        "*" if current entry is tagged, a space otherwise
# %>X       Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
# %|X       Pad to the end of the line with "X"
# %*X       Soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.
#
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the $status_format documentation.
#
#
# set quit=yes
#
# Name: quit
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable controls whether "quit" and "exit" actually quit
# from NeoMutt.  If this option is set, they do quit, if it is unset, they
# have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are
# prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.
#
#
# set quote_regex="^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
#
# Name: quote_regex
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^([ \t]*[|>:}#])+"
#
#
# A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted
# sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text may be filtered
# out using the <toggle-quoted> command, or colored according to the
# "color quoted" family of directives.
#
# Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently ("color quoted1",
# "color quoted2", etc.). The quoting level is determined by removing
# the last character from the matched text and recursively reapplying
# the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.
#
# Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys regular expression.
#
#
# set read_inc=10
#
# Name: read_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
#
#
# If set to a value greater than 0, NeoMutt will display which message it
# is currently on when reading a mailbox or when performing search actions
# such as search and limit. The message is printed after
# this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if set to 25, NeoMutt will
# print a message when it is at message 25, and then again when it gets
# to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
# reading or searching large mailboxes which may take some time.
# When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
# the mailbox.
#
# Also see the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
# "tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.
#
#
# set read_only=no
#
# Name: read_only
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.
#
#
set realname="Rohan Kumar"
#
# Name: realname
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable specifies what "real" or "personal" name should be used
# when sending messages.
#
# If not specified, then the user's "real name" will be read from /etc/passwd.
# This option will not be used, if "$from" is set.
#
#
# set recall=ask-yes
#
# Name: recall
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# Controls whether or not NeoMutt recalls postponed messages
# when composing a new message.
#
# Setting this variable to yes is not generally useful, and thus not
# recommended.  Note that the <recall-message> function can be used
# to manually recall postponed messages.
#
# Also see $postponed variable.
#
#
set record="+Sent"
#
# Name: record
# Type: mailbox
# Default: "~/sent"
#
#
# This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
# appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
# your messages, but another way to do this is using the "my_hdr"
# command to create a "Bcc:" field with your email address in it.)
#
# The value of $record is overridden by the $force_name and
# $save_name variables, and the "fcc-hook" command.  Also see $copy
# and $write_bcc.
#
#
# set reflow_space_quotes=yes
#
# Name: reflow_space_quotes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This option controls how quotes from format=flowed messages are displayed
# in the pager and when replying (with $text_flowed unset).
# When set, this option adds spaces after each level of quote marks, turning
# ">>>foo" into "> > > foo".
#
# Note: If $reflow_text is unset, this option has no effect.
# Also, this option does not affect replies when $text_flowed is set.
#
#
# set reflow_text=yes
#
# Name: reflow_text
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will reformat paragraphs in text/plain
# parts marked format=flowed.  If unset, NeoMutt will display paragraphs
# unaltered from how they appear in the message body.  See RFC3676 for
# details on the format=flowed format.
#
# Also see $reflow_wrap, and $wrap.
#
#
# set reflow_wrap=78
#
# Name: reflow_wrap
# Type: number
# Default: 78
#
#
# This variable controls the maximum paragraph width when reformatting text/plain
# parts when $reflow_text is set.  When the value is 0, paragraphs will
# be wrapped at the terminal's right margin.  A positive value sets the
# paragraph width relative to the left margin.  A negative value set the
# paragraph width relative to the right margin.
#
# Also see $wrap.
#
#
# set reply_regex="^((re|aw|sv)(\\[[0-9]+\\])*:[ \t]*)*"
#
# Name: reply_regex
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "^((re|aw|sv)(\\[[0-9]+\\])*:[ \t]*)*"
#
#
# A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
# and replying. The default value corresponds to the English "Re:", the
# German "Aw:" and the Swedish "Sv:".
#
#
# set reply_self=no
#
# Name: reply_self
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, NeoMutt will
# assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
# than to yourself.
#
# Also see the "alternates" command.
#
#
# set reply_to=ask-yes
#
# Name: reply_to
# Type: quadoption
# Default: ask-yes
#
#
# If set, when replying to a message, NeoMutt will use the address listed
# in the Reply-to: header as the recipient of the reply.  If unset,
# it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
# option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
# header field to the list address and you want to send a private
# message to the author of a message.
#
#
# set reply_with_xorig=no
#
# Name: reply_with_xorig
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable provides a toggle. When active, the From: header will be
# extracted from the current mail's 'X-Original-To:' header. This setting
# does not have precedence over "reverse_realname".
#
# Assuming 'fast_reply' is disabled, this option will prompt the user with a
# prefilled From: header.
#
#
# set resolve=yes
#
# Name: resolve
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
# (possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
# current message is executed.
#
#
# set resume_draft_files=no
#
# Name: resume_draft_files
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, draft files (specified by -H on the command
# line) are processed similarly to when resuming a postponed
# message.  Recipients are not prompted for; send-hooks are not
# evaluated; no alias expansion takes place; user-defined headers
# and signatures are not added to the message.
#
#
# set resume_edited_draft_files=yes
#
# Name: resume_edited_draft_files
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, draft files previously edited (via -E -H on
# the command line) will have $resume_draft_files automatically
# set when they are used as a draft file again.
#
# The first time a draft file is saved, NeoMutt will add a header,
# X-Mutt-Resume-Draft to the saved file.  The next time the draft
# file is read in, if NeoMutt sees the header, it will set
# $resume_draft_files.
#
# This option is designed to prevent multiple signatures,
# user-defined headers, and other processing effects from being
# made multiple times to the draft file.
#
#
# set reverse_alias=no
#
# Name: reverse_alias
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable controls whether or not NeoMutt will display the "personal"
# name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
# matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
# alias:
# alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)
#
# and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
# From: abd30425@somewhere.net
#
# It would be displayed in the index menu as "Joe User" instead of
# "abd30425@somewhere.net."  This is useful when the person's e-mail
# address is not human friendly.
#
#
# set reverse_name=no
#
# Name: reverse_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
# move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
# from there.  If this variable is set, the default From: line of
# the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
# messages you are replying to if that address matches your
# "alternates".  If the variable is unset, or the address that would be
# used doesn't match your "alternates", the From: line will use
# your address on the current machine.
#
# Also see the "alternates" command and $reverse_realname.
#
#
# set reverse_realname=yes
#
# Name: reverse_realname
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable fine-tunes the behavior of the $reverse_name feature.
#
# When it is unset, NeoMutt will remove the real name part of a
# matching address.  This allows the use of the email address
# without having to also use what the sender put in the real name
# field.
#
# When it is set, NeoMutt will use the matching address as-is.
#
# In either case, a missing real name will be filled in afterwards
# using the value of $realname.
#
#
# set rfc2047_parameters=no
#
# Name: rfc2047_parameters
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When this variable is set, NeoMutt will decode RFC2047-encoded MIME
# parameters. You want to set this variable when NeoMutt suggests you
# to save attachments to files named like:
# =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
# =?utf-8?Q?z=C4=99ta.png?=
#
# When this variable is set interactively, the change won't be
# active until you change folders.
#
# Note that this use of RFC2047's encoding is explicitly
# prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
# wild and produced by, e.g., Outlook.
#
# Also note that setting this parameter will not have the effect
# that NeoMutt generates this kind of encoding.  Instead, NeoMutt will
# unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.
#
#
# set save_address=no
#
# Name: save_address
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
# default folder for saving a mail. If $save_name or $force_name
# is set too, the selection of the Fcc folder will be changed as well.
#
#
# set save_empty=yes
#
# Name: save_empty
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
# when closed (the exception is $spoolfile which is never removed).
# If set, mailboxes are never removed.
#
# Note: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, NeoMutt does not
# delete MH and Maildir directories.
#
#
# set save_history=0
#
# Name: save_history
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# This variable controls the size of the history (per category) saved in the
# $history_file file.
#
#
# set save_name=no
#
# Name: save_name
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
# When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
# recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
# the $folder directory with the username part of the
# recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
# be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
# $record mailbox.
#
# Also see the $force_name variable.
#
#
# set save_unsubscribed=no
#
# Name: save_unsubscribed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, info about unsubscribed newsgroups will be saved into
# "newsrc" file and into cache.
#
#
# set score=yes
#
# Name: score
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When this variable is unset, scoring is turned off.  This can
# be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
# $score_threshold_delete variable and related are used.
#
#
# set score_threshold_delete=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_delete
# Type: number
# Default: -1
#
#
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by NeoMutt.  Since
# NeoMutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.
#
#
# set score_threshold_flag=9999
#
# Name: score_threshold_flag
# Type: number
# Default: 9999
#
#
# Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this
# variable's value are automatically marked "flagged".
#
#
# set score_threshold_read=-1
#
# Name: score_threshold_read
# Type: number
# Default: -1
#
#
# Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
# of this variable are automatically marked as read by NeoMutt.  Since
# NeoMutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
# of this variable will never mark a message read.
#
#
# set search_context=0
#
# Name: search_context
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# For the pager, this variable specifies the number of lines shown
# before search results. By default, search results will be top-aligned.
#
#
# set send_charset="us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
#
# Name: send_charset
# Type: string
# Default: "us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8"
#
#
# A colon-delimited list of character sets for outgoing messages. NeoMutt will use the
# first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
# If your $charset is not "iso-8859-1" and recipients may not
# understand "UTF-8", it is advisable to include in the list an
# appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
# "iso-8859-2", "koi8-r" or "iso-2022-jp") either instead of or after
# "iso-8859-1".
#
# In case the text can't be converted into one of these exactly,
# NeoMutt uses $charset as a fallback.
#
#
set sendmail="/usr/sbin/sendmail"
#
# Name: sendmail
# Type: command
# Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi"
#
#
# Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by NeoMutt.
# NeoMutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
# arguments as recipient addresses.  NeoMutt appends all recipients after
# adding a -- delimiter (if not already present).  Additional
# flags, such as for $use_8bitmime, $use_envelope_from,
# $dsn_notify, or $dsn_return will be added before the delimiter.
#
# See also: $write_bcc.
#
#
# set sendmail_wait=0
#
# Name: sendmail_wait
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the $sendmail process
# to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.

#
#
# set sig_dashes=yes
#
# Name: sig_dashes
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set, a line containing "-- " (note the trailing space) will be inserted before your
# $signature.  It is strongly recommended that you not unset
# this variable unless your signature contains just your name.  The
# reason for this is because many software packages use "-- \n" to
# detect your signature.  For example, NeoMutt has the ability to highlight
# the signature in a different color in the built-in pager.
#
#
# set sig_on_top=no
#
# Name: sig_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
# text.  It is strongly recommended that you do not set this variable
# unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
# some heat from netiquette guardians.
#
#
# set signature="~/.signature"
#
# Name: signature
# Type: path
# Default: "~/.signature"
#
#
# Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
# outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe ("|"), it is
# assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
# its standard output.
#
#
# set simple_search="~f %s | ~s %s"
#
# Name: simple_search
# Type: string
# Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"
#
#
# Specifies how NeoMutt should expand a simple search into a real search
# pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the "~" pattern
# operators.  See "patterns" for more information on search patterns.
#
# For example, if you simply type "joe" at a search or limit prompt, NeoMutt
# will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable by
# replacing "%s" with the supplied string.
# For the default value, "joe" would be expanded to: "~f joe | ~s joe".
#
#
# set size_show_bytes=no
#
# Name: size_show_bytes
# Type: boolean

#
# Lines of quoted text that are displayed before the unquoted text after
# "skip to quoted" command (S)
#
#
# set sleep_time=1
#
# Name: sleep_time
# Type: number
# Default: 1
#
#
# Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
# messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
# messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so
# a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.
#
#
# set smart_wrap=yes
#
# Name: smart_wrap
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in the
# internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
# unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
# $markers variable.
#
#
# set smileys="(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
#
# Name: smileys
# Type: regular expression
# Default: "(>From )|(:[-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
#
#
# The pager uses this variable to catch some common false
# positives of $quote_regex, most notably smileys and not consider
# a line quoted text if it also matches $smileys. This mostly
# happens at the beginning of a line.
#
#
# set smime_ask_cert_label=yes
#
# Name: smime_ask_cert_label
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter a label

# (S/MIME only)
#
#
# set smime_certificates=""
#
# Name: smime_certificates
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, NeoMutt has to handle
# storage and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right
# now, and keys and certificates are stored in two different
# directories, both named as the hash-value retrieved from
# OpenSSL. There is an index file which contains mailbox-address
# keyid pairs, and which can be manually edited. This option points to

# (S/MIME only)
#
#
# set smime_decrypt_command=""
#
# Name: smime_decrypt_command
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# This format string specifies a command which is used to decrypt
# application/x-pkcs7-mime attachments.
#
# The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences
# similar to PGP's:
# %f      Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
# %s      Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
#         of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
# %k      The key-pair specified with $smime_default_key
# %i      Intermediate certificates
# %c      One or more certificate IDs.
# %a      The algorithm used for encryption.
# %d      The message digest algorithm specified with $smime_sign_digest_alg.
# %C      CA location:  Depending on whether $smime_ca_location
#         points to a directory or file, this expands to
#         "-CApath $smime_ca_location" or "-CAfile $smime_ca_location".

# Default: yes
#
#
# If set (default) this tells NeoMutt to use the default key for decryption. Otherwise,

# - alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
# - unsorted (leave in order specified in .neomuttrc)
#
#
set sort_aux=last-date-received
#
# Name: sort_aux
# Type: sort order
# Default: date
#
#
# This provides a secondary sort for messages in the "index" menu, used
# when the $sort value is equal for two messages.
#
# When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
# in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
# are sorted.  This can be set to any value that $sort can, except
# "threads" (in that case, NeoMutt will just use "date-sent").  You can also
# specify the "last-" prefix in addition to the "reverse-" prefix, but "last-"
# must come after "reverse-".  The "last-" prefix causes messages to be
# sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
# the rest of $sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance,
# set sort_aux=last-date-received
#
# would mean that if a new message is received in a
# thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
# you have "set sort=reverse-threads".)
#
# Note: For reversed-threads $sort
# order, $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
# but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).
#
#
# set sort_browser=alpha
#
# Name: sort_browser
# Type: sort order
# Default: alpha
#
#
# Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
# entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
# - alpha (alphabetically)
# - count (all message count)
# - date
# - desc (description)
# - new (new message count)
# - size
# - unsorted
#
#
# You may optionally use the "reverse-" prefix to specify reverse sorting
# order (example: "set sort_browser=reverse-date").
#
#
# set sort_re=yes
#
# Name: sort_re
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# This variable is only useful when sorting by mailboxes in sidebar. By default,
# entries are unsorted.  Valid values:
# - count (all message count)
# - desc  (virtual mailbox description)
# - new (new message count)
# - path
# - unsorted
#
#
# set spam_separator=","
#
# Name: spam_separator
# Type: string
# Default: ","
#
#
# This variable controls what happens when multiple spam headers
# are matched: if unset, each successive header will overwrite any
# previous matches value for the spam label. If set, each successive
# match will append to the previous, using this variable's value as a
# separator.
#
#
set spoolfile="~/mail/seirdy2"
#
# Name: spoolfile
# Type: mailbox
# Default: ""
#
#
# If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where NeoMutt can't find
# it, you can specify its location with this variable. The description from
# "named-mailboxes" or "virtual-mailboxes" may be used for the spoolfile.
#
# If not specified, then the environment variables $MAIL and
# $MAILDIR will be checked.
#
#
# set ssl_ca_certificates_file=""
#
# Name: ssl_ca_certificates_file
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.
# Any server certificate that is signed with one of these CA
# certificates is also automatically accepted. (GnuTLS only)
#
# Example:
# set ssl_ca_certificates_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
#
#
# set ssl_ciphers=""
#
# Name: ssl_ciphers
# Type: string
# Default: ""
#
#
# Contains a colon-separated list of ciphers to use when using SSL.
# For OpenSSL, see ciphers(1) for the syntax of the string.
#
# For GnuTLS, this option will be used in place of "NORMAL" at the
# start of the priority string.  See gnutls_priority_init(3) for the
# syntax and more details. (Note: GnuTLS version 2.1.7 or higher is
# required.)
#
#
# set ssl_client_cert=""
#
# Name: ssl_client_cert
# Type: path
# Default: ""
#
#
# The file containing a client certificate and its associated private
# key.
#
#
# set ssl_force_tls=no
#
# Name: ssl_force_tls
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If this variable is set, NeoMutt will require that all connections
# to remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it will attempt to
# negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the capability,
# since it would otherwise have to abort the connection anyway. This
# option supersedes $ssl_starttls.
#
#
# set ssl_min_dh_prime_bits=0
#
# Name: ssl_min_dh_prime_bits
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime size (in bits)
# for use in any Diffie-Hellman key exchange. A value of 0 will use
# the default from the GNUTLS library. (GnuTLS only)
#
#
# set ssl_starttls=yes
#
# Name: ssl_starttls
# Type: quadoption
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set (the default), NeoMutt will attempt to use STARTTLS on servers
# advertising the capability. When unset, NeoMutt will not attempt to
# use STARTTLS regardless of the server's capabilities.
#
# Note that STARTTLS is subject to many kinds of
# attacks, including the ability of a machine-in-the-middle to
# suppress the advertising of support.  Setting $ssl_force_tls is
# recommended if you rely on STARTTLS.
#
#
# set ssl_use_sslv2=no
#
# Name: ssl_use_sslv2
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use SSLv2 when communicating with servers that
# request it. N.B. As of 2011, SSLv2 is considered insecure, and using
# is inadvisable. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176 .
# (OpenSSL only)
#
#
# set ssl_use_sslv3=no
#
# Name: ssl_use_sslv3
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use SSLv3 when communicating with servers that
# request it. N.B. As of 2015, SSLv3 is considered insecure, and using
# it is inadvisable. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525 .
#
#
# set ssl_use_tlsv1=no
#
# Name: ssl_use_tlsv1
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.0 when communicating with servers that
# request it. N.B. As of 2015, TLSv1.0 is considered insecure, and using
# it is inadvisable. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525 .
#
#
# set ssl_use_tlsv1_1=no
#
# Name: ssl_use_tlsv1_1
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.1 when communicating with servers that
# request it. N.B. As of 2015, TLSv1.1 is considered insecure, and using
# it is inadvisable. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7525 .
#
#
# set ssl_use_tlsv1_2=yes
#
# Name: ssl_use_tlsv1_2
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.2 when communicating with servers that
# request it.
#
#
# set ssl_use_tlsv1_3=yes
#
# Name: ssl_use_tlsv1_3
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set , NeoMutt will use TLSv1.3 when communicating with servers that
# request it.
#
#
# set ssl_usesystemcerts=yes
#
# Name: ssl_usesystemcerts
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set to yes, NeoMutt will use CA certificates in the
# system-wide certificate store when checking if a server certificate
# is signed by a trusted CA. (OpenSSL only)
#
#
# set ssl_verify_dates=yes
#
# Name: ssl_verify_dates
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set (the default), NeoMutt will not automatically accept a server
# certificate that is either not yet valid or already expired. You should
# only unset this for particular known hosts, using the
# <account-hook> function.
#
#
# set ssl_verify_host=yes
#
# Name: ssl_verify_host
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# If set (the default), NeoMutt will not automatically accept a server
# certificate whose host name does not match the host used in your folder
# URL. You should only unset this for particular known hosts, using
# the <account-hook> function.
#
#
# set ssl_verify_partial_chains=no
#
# Name: ssl_verify_partial_chains
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# This option should not be changed from the default unless you understand
# what you are doing.
#
# Setting this variable to yes will permit verifying partial
# certification chains, i. e. a certificate chain where not the root,
# but an intermediate certificate CA, or the host certificate, are
# marked trusted (in $certificate_file), without marking the root
# signing CA as trusted.
#
# (OpenSSL 1.0.2b and newer only).
#
#
# set status_chars="-*%A"
#
# Name: status_chars
# Type: character string
# Default: "-*%A"
#
#
# Controls the characters used by the "%r" indicator in $status_format.
# Character Default Description
# 1       - Mailbox is unchanged
# 2       * Mailbox has been changed and needs to be resynchronized
# 3       % Mailbox is read-only, or will not be written when exiting.
#         (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
#         with the <toggle-write> operation, bound by default
#         to "%")
# 4       A Folder opened in attach-message mode.
#         (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
#         forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode)
#
#
# set status_format="-%r-NeoMutt: %D [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
#
# Name: status_format
# Type: string
# Default: "-%r-NeoMutt: %D [Msgs:%?M?%M/?%m%?n? New:%n?%?o? Old:%o?%?d? Del:%d?%?F? Flag:%F?%?t? Tag:%t?%?p? Post:%p?%?b? Inc:%b?%?l? %l?]---(%s/%S)-%>-(%P)---"
#
#
# Controls the format of the status line displayed in the "index"
# menu.  This string is similar to $index_format, but has its own
# set of printf(3)-like sequences:
# %b      * Number of mailboxes with new mail
# %d      * Number of deleted messages
# %D        Description of the mailbox
# %f        The full pathname of the current mailbox
# %F      * Number of flagged messages
# %h        Local hostname
# %l      * Size (in bytes) of the current mailbox (see formatstrings-size)
# %L      * Size (in bytes) of the messages shown
#         (i.e., which match the current limit) (see formatstrings-size)
# %m      * The number of messages in the mailbox
# %M      * The number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit)
# %n      * Number of new messages in the mailbox (unread, unseen)
# %o      * Number of old messages in the mailbox (unread, seen)
# %p      * Number of postponed messages
# %P        Percentage of the way through the index
# %r        Modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator,
#         According to $status_chars
# %R      * Number of read messages in the mailbox (read, seen)
# %s        Current sorting mode ($sort)
# %S        Current aux sorting method ($sort_aux)
# %t      * Number of tagged messages in the mailbox
# %u      * Number of unread messages in the mailbox (seen or unseen)
# %v        NeoMutt version string
# %V      * Currently active limit pattern, if any
# %>X       Right justify the rest of the string and pad with "X"
# %|X       Pad to the end of the line with "X"
# %*X       Soft-fill with character "X" as pad
#
#
# For an explanation of "soft-fill", see the $index_format documentation.
#
# * = can be optionally printed if nonzero
#
# Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
# if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
# number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
# particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
# of the above sequences, the following construct is used:
#
# %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?
#
# where sequence_char is a character from the table above, and
# optional_string is the string you would like printed if
# sequence_char is nonzero.  optional_string may contain
# other sequences as well as normal text, but you may not nest
# optional strings.
#
# Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
# new messages in a mailbox:
#
# %?n?%n new messages.?
#
# You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
#
# %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?
#
# If the value of sequence_char is non-zero, if_string will
# be expanded, otherwise else_string will be expanded.
#
# You can force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be lowercase
# by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore ("_") sign.
# For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase,
# you would use: "%_h".
#
# If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (":") character, NeoMutt
# will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful
# with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.
#
#
# set status_on_top=no
#
# Name: status_on_top
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Setting this variable causes the "status bar" to be displayed on
# the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom. If $help
# is set, too it'll be placed at the bottom.
#
#
# set strict_threads=no
#
# Name: strict_threads
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, threading will only make use of the "In-Reply-To" and
# "References:" fields when you $sort by message threads.  By
# default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
# "pseudo threads.". This may not always be desirable, such as in a
# personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
# the subjects like "hi" which will get grouped together. See also
# $sort_re for a less drastic way of controlling this
# behavior.
#
#
# set suspend=yes
#
# Name: suspend
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When unset, NeoMutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
# susp key, usually "^Z". This is useful if you run NeoMutt
# inside an xterm using a command like "xterm -e neomutt".
#
#
set text_flowed=yes
#
# Name: text_flowed
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will generate "format=flowed" bodies with a content type
# of "text/plain; format=flowed".
# This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
# just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's
# features, you'll need support in your editor.
#
# The option only controls newly composed messages.  Postponed messages,
# resent messages, and draft messages (via -H on the command line) will
# use the content-type of the source message.
#
# Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is set.
#
#
# set thorough_search=yes
#
# Name: thorough_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Affects the ~b and ~h search operations described in
# section "patterns".  If set, the headers and body/attachments of
# messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If unset,
# messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
#
# Users searching attachments or for non-ASCII characters should set
# this value because decoding also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible
# character set conversions. Otherwise NeoMutt will attempt to match against the
# raw message received (for example quoted-printable encoded or with encoded
# headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.
#
#
# set thread_received=no
#
# Name: thread_received
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
# to thread messages by subject.
#
#
# set tilde=no
#
# Name: tilde
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
# screen with a tilde ("~").
#
#
# set time_inc=0
#
# Name: time_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# Along with $read_inc, $write_inc, and $net_inc, this
# variable controls the frequency with which progress updates are
# displayed. It suppresses updates less than $time_inc milliseconds
# apart. This can improve throughput on systems with slow terminals,
# or when running NeoMutt on a remote system.
#
# Also see the "tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.
#
#
# set timeout=600
#
# Name: timeout
# Type: number
# Default: 600
#
#
# When NeoMutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or
# in an interactive prompt, NeoMutt would block until input is
# present. Depending on the context, this would prevent certain
# operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping
# an IMAP connection alive.
#
# This variable controls how many seconds NeoMutt will at most wait
# until it aborts waiting for input, performs these operations and
# continues to wait for input.
#
# A value of zero or less will cause NeoMutt to never time out.
#
#
# set tmpdir="/tmp"
#
# Name: tmpdir
# Type: path
# Default: "/tmp"
#
#
# This variable allows you to specify where NeoMutt will place its
# temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.
#
# If this variable is not set, the environment variable $TMPDIR is
# used.  Failing that, then "/tmp" is used.
#
#
# set to_chars=" +TCFLR"
#
# Name: to_chars
# Type: character string
# Default: " +TCFLR"
#
#
# Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.
# Character Default Description
# 1       <space> The mail is not addressed to your address.
# 2       + You are the only recipient of the message.
# 3       T Your address appears in the "To:" header field, but you are not the only recipient of the message.
# 4       C Your address is specified in the "Cc:" header field, but you are not the only recipient.
# 5       F Indicates the mail that was sent by you.
# 6       L Indicates the mail was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to.
# 7       R Your address appears in the "Reply-To:" header field but none of the above applies.
#
#
# set toggle_quoted_show_levels=0
#
# Name: toggle_quoted_show_levels
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# Quoted text may be filtered out using the <toggle-quoted> command.
# If set to a number greater than 0, then the <toggle-quoted>
# command will only filter out quote levels above this number.
#
#
set trash="+Trash"
#
# Name: trash
# Type: mailbox
# Default: ""
#
#
# If set, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the
# mails marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably
# purged.
#
# NOTE: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really
# deleted, so that you have a way to clean the trash.
#
#
# set ts_enabled=no
#
# Name: ts_enabled
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether NeoMutt tries to set the terminal status line and icon name.
# Most terminal emulators emulate the status line in the window title.
#
#
# set ts_icon_format="M%?n?AIL&ail?"
#
# Name: ts_icon_format
# Type: string
# Default: "M%?n?AIL&ail?"
#
#
# Controls the format of the icon title, as long as "$ts_enabled" is set.
# This string is identical in formatting to the one used by
# "$status_format".
#
#
# set ts_status_format="NeoMutt with %?m?%m messages&no messages?%?n? [%n NEW]?"
#
# Name: ts_status_format
# Type: string
# Default: "NeoMutt with %?m?%m messages&no messages?%?n? [%n NEW]?"
#
#
# Controls the format of the terminal status line (or window title),
# provided that "$ts_enabled" has been set. This string is identical in
# formatting to the one used by "$status_format".
#
#
# set tunnel=""
#
# Name: tunnel
# Type: command
# Default: ""
#
#
# Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to open a pipe to a command
# instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
# preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:
# set tunnel="ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"
#
# Note: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
# machine without having to enter a password.
#
# When set, NeoMutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.
# Please see "account-hook" in the manual for how to use different
# tunnel commands per connection.
#
#
# set tunnel_is_secure=yes
#
# Name: tunnel_is_secure
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will assume the $tunnel connection does not need
# STARTTLS to be enabled.  It will also allow IMAP PREAUTH server
# responses inside a tunnel to proceed.  This is appropriate if $tunnel
# uses ssh or directly invokes the server locally.
#
# When unset, NeoMutt will negotiate STARTTLS according to the
# ssl_starttls and ssl_force_tls variables.  If ssl_force_tls is
# set, NeoMutt will abort connecting if an IMAP server responds with PREAUTH.
# This setting is appropriate if $tunnel does not provide security and
# could be tampered with by attackers.
#
#
# set uncollapse_jump=no
#
# Name: uncollapse_jump
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
# when the current thread is uncollapsed.
#
#
# set uncollapse_new=yes
#
# Name: uncollapse_new
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will automatically uncollapse any collapsed thread
# that receives a new message. When unset, collapsed threads will
# remain collapsed. the presence of the new message will still affect
# index sorting, though.
#
#
# set use_8bitmime=no
#
# Name: use_8bitmime
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Warning: do not set this variable unless you are using a version
# of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail
# 8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
#
# When set, NeoMutt will invoke $sendmail with the -B8BITMIME
# flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.
#
#
# set use_domain=yes
#
# Name: use_domain
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
# "@host" portion) with the value of $hostname.  If unset, no
# addresses will be qualified.
#
#
# set use_envelope_from=no
#
# Name: use_envelope_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will set the envelope sender of the message.
# If $envelope_from_address is set, it will be used as the sender
# address. If unset, NeoMutt will attempt to derive the sender from the
# "From:" header.
#
# Note that this information is passed to sendmail command using the
# -f command line switch. Therefore setting this option is not useful
# if the $sendmail variable already contains -f or if the
# executable pointed to by $sendmail doesn't support the -f switch.
#
#
# set use_from=yes
#
# Name: use_from
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will generate the "From:" header field when
# sending messages.  If unset, no "From:" header field will be
# generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the "my_hdr"
# command.
#
#
# set use_ipv6=yes
#
# Name: use_ipv6
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
# contact.  If this option is unset, NeoMutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
# Normally, the default should work.
#
#
# set user_agent=no
#
# Name: user_agent
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will add a "User-Agent:" header to outgoing
# messages, indicating which version of NeoMutt was used for composing
# them.
#
#
# set vfolder_format="%2C %?n?%4n/&     ?%4m %f"
#
# Name: vfolder_format
# Type: string
# Default: "%2C %?n?%4n/&     ?%4m %f"
#
#
# This variable allows you to customize the file browser display for virtual
# folders to your personal taste.  This string uses many of the same
# expandos as $folder_format.
#
#
# set virtual_spoolfile=no
#
# Name: virtual_spoolfile
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will use the first defined virtual mailbox (see
# virtual-mailboxes) as a spool file.
#
# This command is now unnecessary. $spoolfile has been extended to support
# mailbox descriptions as a value.
#
#
# set visual="vi"
#
# Name: visual
# Type: command
# Default: "vi"
#
#
# Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the "~v" command is
# given in the built-in editor.
#
# $visual is overridden by the environment variable $VISUAL or $EDITOR.
#
#
# set wait_key=yes
#
# Name: wait_key
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls whether NeoMutt will ask you to press a key after an external command
# has been invoked by these functions: <shell-escape>,
# <pipe-message>, <pipe-entry>, <print-message>,
# and <print-entry> commands.
#
# It is also used when viewing attachments with "auto_view", provided
# that the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag,
# and the external program is interactive.
#
# When set, NeoMutt will always ask for a key. When unset, NeoMutt will wait
# for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.
#
#
# set weed=yes
#
# Name: weed
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# When set, NeoMutt will weed headers when displaying, forwarding,
# or replying to messages.
#
# Also see $copy_decode_weed, $pipe_decode_weed, $print_decode_weed.
#
#
# set wrap=0
#
# Name: wrap
# Type: number
# Default: 0
#
#
# When set to a positive value, NeoMutt will wrap text at $wrap characters.
# When set to a negative value, NeoMutt will wrap text so that there are $wrap
# characters of empty space on the right side of the terminal. Setting it
# to zero makes NeoMutt wrap at the terminal width.
#
# Also see $reflow_wrap.
#
#
# set wrap_headers=78
#
# Name: wrap_headers
# Type: number
# Default: 78
#
#
# This option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping
# an outgoing message's headers. Allowed values are between 78 and 998
# inclusive.
#
# Note: This option usually shouldn't be changed. RFC5233
# recommends a line length of 78 (the default), so please only change
# this setting when you know what you're doing.
#
#
# set wrap_search=yes
#
# Name: wrap_search
# Type: boolean
# Default: yes
#
#
# Controls whether searches wrap around the end.
#
# When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) item. When
# unset, incremental searches will not wrap.
#
#
# set write_bcc=no
#
# Name: write_bcc
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# Controls whether NeoMutt writes out the "Bcc:" header when
# preparing messages to be sent.  Some MTAs, such as Exim and
# Courier, do not strip the "Bcc:" header; so it is advisable to
# leave this unset unless you have a particular need for the header
# to be in the sent message.
#
# If NeoMutt is set to deliver directly via SMTP(see $smtp_url),
# this option does nothing: NeoMutt will never write out the "Bcc:"
# header in this case.
#
# Note this option only affects the sending of messages.  Fcc'ed
# copies of a message will always contain the "Bcc:" header if
# one exists.
#
#
# set write_inc=10
#
# Name: write_inc
# Type: number
# Default: 10
#
#
# When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
# $write_inc messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
# single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
#
# Also see the $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
# "tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.
#
#
# set x_comment_to=no
#
# Name: x_comment_to
# Type: boolean
# Default: no
#
#
# If set, NeoMutt will add "X-Comment-To:" field (that contains full
# name of original article author) to article that followuped to newsgroup.

# Command formats for gpg.
#
# Version notes:
#
#   GPG 2.1 introduces the option "--pinentry-mode", which requires
#   the "loopback" argument in instances where "--passphrase-fd" is
#   used.
#
# Some of the older commented-out versions of the commands use gpg-2comp from:
#   http://70t.de/download/gpg-2comp.tar.gz
#
# %p    The empty string when no passphrase is needed,
#       the string "PGPPASSFD=0" if one is needed.
#
#       This is mostly used in conditional % sequences.
#
# %f    Most PGP commands operate on a single file or a file
#       containing a message.  %f expands to this file's name.
#
# %s    When verifying signatures, there is another temporary file
#       containing the detached signature.  %s expands to this
#       file's name.
#
# %a    In "signing" contexts, this expands to the value of the
#       configuration variable $pgp_sign_as, if set, otherwise
#       $pgp_default_key.  You probably need to
#       use this within a conditional % sequence.
#
# %r    In many contexts, neomutt passes key IDs to pgp.  %r expands to
#       a list of key IDs.

# Section A: Key Management

# The default key for encryption (used by $pgp_self_encrypt and
# $postpone_encrypt).
#
# It will also be used for signing unless $pgp_sign_as is set to a
# key.
#
# Unless your key does not have encryption capability, uncomment this
# line and replace the keyid with your own.

# capability, uncomment this line and replace the keyid with your
# signing keyid.
